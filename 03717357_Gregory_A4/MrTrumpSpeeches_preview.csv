amazing to be watching what i was   watching and some of the pundits and I   you know overall fair but not too much   but a number of the pundits and well if   a couple of the other candidates dropped   out if you add their scores together   it's going to equal Trump right these   geniuses they're geniuses they don't   understand that as people drop out I'm   going to get a lot of those votes all so   you don't just you're just add them   together   [Applause]   so I think we're going to do very very   well I think we're going to do very well   I want to also congratulate the other   candidates in particular I have to say   Ted and Marco did a really good job and   they got they did quite well as I   understand him and come on just of just   one minute come on one second right good   okay we go back to for tomorrow morning   tomorrow morning we'll be back but I   just want to congratulate the other   candidates there's nothing easy about   running for president I can tell you   it's tough it's nasty its mean it's   vicious it's beautiful when you win it's   beautiful and we're going to start we   are going to start winning for our   country we're gonna start women because   our country does it win anymore doesn't   one we don't win with the military we   can't beat Isis we have great military   but we can't be nice as we don't win on   trade you look at what China is doing to   us what Japan does to us what Mexico is   just killing us at the border at the   border and with trade Mexico is killing   us absolutely will do the wall don't   worry we're going to do the wall we're   going to do the wall and by the way   who's going to pay for the wall Mexico   is going to pay for the world and it's   very easy the other politicians come   down you can't get Mexico to pay for the   wall I said one hundred percent we have   a fifty eight billion dollar trade   deficit with mexico the wall is going to   cause 10 to 12 billion dollars okay   believe me they will pay one of the   officials actually one of the ex   officials from mexico had a news   conference and he announced that we will   not be paying for the wall who does mr.   Trump think he is they came to me the   press these people look at all those   cameras back there the press came to me   and they told me that he said would not   pay for the wall do you have a comment I   said yes the wall just got 10 feet   taller   it's true and I love Mexico I love   Mexico I love China I love many of these   countries that rip us off because we   have leaders that are incompetent and   don't know what they're doing I love   these countries they great I have   thousands and thousands of Hispanics   we're going to Nevada I lead I lead with   the Hispanics I'm leading in every poll   with Hispanics they love me I love them   the problem is the problem is that the   leaders of these countries whether it's   Mexico or Japan or Vietnam which is just   doing a big number now all of a sudden   or China in particular that's the big   one the greatest abuse of a country that   I think I've ever seen financially China   what they've done to us is the greatest   single theft in the history of the world   they've taken our jobs they've taken our   money they've taken everything we're   bringing our jobs back folks we're   bringing our jobs back we're going to   bring them back and I know how to do it   we've had so many we've had so many   incredible endorsements and to me   getting the greatest business people to   endorse me as very important Carl Icahn   endorse me so many others have endorsed   me and we're going to put these great   business people in charge of trade and   when China wants to come and negotiate   they're going to negotiate not with a   political hack which is what they have   now they're going to negotiate with the   best business minds in the world and we   have them in this country   so we're going to do a lot of beautiful   work we're going to terminate Obamacare   it's going to be terminated it's going   to be over it's going to be repealed and   it's going to be replaced and you're   going to have much better health care at   a much smaller cost because Obamacare if   you look look at the increases in your   Obamacare 25 35 45 even fifty five   percent it's dead it's not working we're   going to go to a plan that's going to be   so much better and so much less   expensive so second amendment by the way   this is a room loves the Second   Amendment thank you fellas this is a   room loves and cherishes the Second   Amendment we are going to protect our   Second Amendment   [Applause]   common core is gone we are getting rid   of common core we're bringing education   to a local level the people in this   community every time I see them they   want education locally the parents the   teachers they want to do it they don't   want bureaucrats in Washington telling   them how to educate their children we   spend as a nation more for education /   pupal than any other nation in the world   not even close more per pupil second   place doesn't even exist it's so   different and yet out of 30 countries   were ranked number 30 you have China you   have Norway Sweden Denmark and then you   have number 30 the United States so we   spend the most and we're at the bottom   of the heap it's not going to happen   anymore folks not going to happen   anymore we are going to build our   military which I thank because a number   of the people came down in a number of   the pundits and watching tonight we love   our military   we love our military and by the way we   love our police our police are terrific   we love our police they are not being   treated properly we're going to build   our military so big so good so strong so   powerful that nobody is ever going to   mess with us folks and we're going to   buy we're going to buy the equipment   that our generals are soldiers that   everybody that's in the note want we're   not buying equipment that sells because   they have political well because they   take campaign and they give campaign   contributions we are going to get the   equipment that they want not the   equipment that they're told to have by   senators and congressmen in Washington   we're going to have great equipment and   the reason i can say that is I'm   self-funding my campaign I'm not getting   millions of dollars from all of these   I'm not getting millions of dollars from   all of these special interests and   lobbyists and donors that once they get   it they literally do whatever the   politicians want that's not going to   happen and we're going to take care of   our vets we love our vets and they're   being treated terribly with taking care   of our veterans so we're now off to   Nevada and it's a great state we have   great people we have great people in our   nation no matter where we go I went to   Mobile Alabama 35000 people we went to   Oklahoma recently twice 20000 people   20000 people no matter where we go we   fill up the arenas over here the other   day we had a 9000 we had a 10000 we   have people the only thing that stops   the crowds are the walls because we   can't get them in we have to send   thousands of people away Time magazine   Time magazine last week did an   incredible comfort cover story they said   it's a movement and that's what it is   it's an incredible movement with   incredible people incredible people   [Applause]   [Music]   [Applause]   it's an incredible movement with   incredible people I tell you and whether   we go honestly whether we go to Dallas   or whether we go anywhere you say you go   to LA you go anywhere you say our people   are incredible and you know our theme   what's our theme you know it right right   our theme which I love maybe the   greatest theme of all time right and the   word again eventually is going to come   off we're going to get rid of the whole   theme because what's going to happen   make America great again right and the   last two weeks because I've gotten to   see so many I guess millions when you   add them all up with all of these rooms   and all of these speeches and I've met   so many people but the people are so   incredible that I've been saying make   America great again and it's going to be   greater than ever before that's the kind   of potential we have greater than ever   before so so so I want to thank   everybody I love you all again South   Carolina we will never forget you we   will never forget you we will never ever   forget South Carolina we will never   forget our great volunteers we love our   volunteers will never forget all of the   people that have helped us so much my   family and folks let's go let's have a   big win in Nevada let's have a big win   at the SEC let's put this thing away and   let's make America great again thank you   very much thank you very much   you   [Music]   you   [Music]   you

-64nfy6i58w,Donald Trump Speeches & Events,20161107,LAST RALLY: Donald Trump FINAL CAMPAIGN Rally in Grand Rapids Michigan (11/7/2016) FULL SPEECH,47276.0,4.35802459717,952.0,182.0,   it's now officially Tuesday November a   did you ever think you'd be hearing a   major speech like it around close to one   o'clock in the morning are we crazy is   this crazy crazy but you know we just   left New Hampshire where we're doing   fantastically well   we're up in New Hampshire we're up in   Ohio   we're up in Iowa we're up in North   Carolina we're doing great there we're   up in Florida we're doing really really   well in Pennsylvania   I mean we are doing well these people   the world's most dishonest people the   media   [Music]   they're saying what's going on today   we're going to win the great state of   Michigan and we are going the right   we're hours away from a   once-in-a-lifetime change we're going to   have real change not Obama change   I want to begin tonight by thanking all   of you and all of the people in this   incredible movement you know it's a   movement like has never happened in this   country before it's a movement that   nobody's ever seen before even these   people they talk about it it's one of   the great political phenomena's many of   them have said it even some of them who   truly truly dislike me they've said this   is one of the great phenomenas I mean   look at this place it almost 1 o'clock   in the morning   so I love Michigan and I was the man of   the year or something like four or five   years ago and I came here and have so   many friends in Michigan but I came here   to get the award they asked me to make a   speech I made a speech and I talked   about how Michigan they're ripping your   auto companies apart they're taking you   jobs they're closing your plants they're   moving into Mexico and other places but   mostly to Mexico in this case and I   talked about that and everybody liked me   in Michigan I said but you know we have   to do something about it but I wasn't a   politician but I talked about it and I   kept talking about it and talking about   it and talking and then I see Ford   moving a big plant and then for just two   weeks ago announcing this small cars are   going to be produced and made entirely   in Mexico   and it's getting worse and worse and I   developed a great relationship with the   people of Michigan so the reason I'm   here is that I thought New Hampshire was   going to be my last stage and I heard   that crooked Hillary Clinton was coming   to Michigan I said let's follow it up   and I said there's no place I'd rather   be from my last rally right here in   Michigan late   and   benarjee in life   although this is our last rally of this   campaign it's almost hard to believe we   started a year and a half ago we started   with 17 very talented people governor's   senators dr. ben Carson great guy   lotta talented people and one by one by   one and most of them have been terrific   and give us great support Ben Carson's   one of them as you know but but who   would have thought and now we have one   flawed candidate left to be one flawed   Kappa   it's going to be the very beginning of a   new adventure because the new adventure   we have to win we have to go out and row   but the new adventure is making America   great again we're going to do it   after we win I'm going to be coming back   to Michigan a lot I'm going to be coming   back   every time we open a new factory or a   new automobile plant and we will do it   it will do a lot of expansion we're   going to do a lot of expansion I know   exactly what to do folks we're not going   to lose you jobs anymore we're not going   to lose you job   we are going to bring back the   automobile industry to Michigan bigger   and better and stronger than ever before   you've been mistreated   Michigan now stands at the crossroads of   history   if we win Michigan we will win this   historic election and then we truly will   be able to do all the things we want to   do they won't be taking our jobs any   longer they won't be doing the things   they've been doing to us we'll end up   having great healthcare strong borders   we'll build up our military we have no   choice we have a depleted military we'll   be able to do the things we want to do   when you step into that voting booth   today so today   there is one core question for you to   consider do you want America to be ruled   by the corrupt political class or do you   want America to be ruled by you the   people that's what it is by the people   the way it was supposed to   a long time we've lost track and for   Michigan we will bring back your   automobile production and we will bring   back your industry way do you see what   we do for Michigan   I've been talking about it for a long   time crooked Hillary has not talked   about it folks   she doesn't know where to begin she   talked about bringing industry back to   New York State   when she was a New York state senator   let me tell you not only didn't it come   back look at upstate New York it's a   disaster it got worse people fled   companies fled it's a disaster the   corrupt politicians and their special   interests have ruled over this country   for a very long time   today is our Independence Day   today the American working class is   going to strike back finally real change   begins with immediately repealing and   replacing the disaster known as   Obamacare it's just been announced that   the residents of mission are going to   experience a massive double-digit   premium hike like you wouldn't believe   not going to matter that much honestly   because we're going to terminate it   you're not gonna have to worry about it   ok so well now on the other hand if   something horrible happens tomorrow get   ready to pay a lot more than you're even   paying now but that's not gonna happen   I'm looking at that fantastic young lady   right there   she's shaking her head no way no way not   gonna happen right good not gonna now I   don't think you're gonna have to worry   about the premiums but with Obamacare   premiums is surging companies are   leaving it is yours are fleeing doctors   are quitting and deductibles are going   right through the roof yet Hillary   Clinton wants to double down on   Obamacare making it even more expensive   and it doesn't work it's no good I'm   asking for your vote so we can repeal   and replace Obamacare and save health   for every family in Michigan   [Applause]   we have to do it we don't have a choice   real change also means restoring honesty   to our government so the first thing we   should do let's get rid of Hillary okay   that's probably that would be a very   good first step that's a good first time   Hilary Clinton is the most corrupt   person ever to seek the office of the   presidency of the United States   [Applause]   she is being protected by a totally   rigged system that I've been talking   about for a long time it's a rigged   system now it's up to the American   people to deliver justice at the ballot   box and I don't have to say do it   tomorrow do it in a week you're going to   do it today you're going to sleep for a   couple of hours go to sleep   you go to sleep for a couple of hours   you wake up your castile and then you go   back to sleep or go to work you people   who go to sleep you'll go back to work I   know my people   you'll get up after about two hours   you'll vote and you're going to work   my Michigan people I know I have so many   friends here they work they don't stop   we are finally going to close the   history books on the Clintons and their   lies and schemes and corruption we will   open a bright new chapter focus on you   the American people my contract with the   American voter begins with a plan to end   government corruption and to take our   country back from the special interests   I want the entire corrupt Washington   establishment to hear our words our   words when we say you know what we're   going to say we're going to win today   and we're going to Washington DC to   drain the swamp   you probably heard me say it rain the   swamp   it is this beautiful isn't it too bad   that the corrupt media never show the   crowds you know   [Applause]   I think they said 18000 people here   every corner look at this every corner   and you know they'll say Donald Trump is   speaking before a crowd of people ah   these people are the worst he speaking   in front of a few thousand people   at the core of my contract is my plan to   bring back our jobs the trade policies   of Hillary Clinton from NAFTA to China   to career to the trans-pacific   partnership which by the way is a   disaster have raided your factories   crushed your auto industry and gutted   your communities you know it and she's   not luck folks   honestly you couldn't give her a shot   you're wasting your time you're wasting   your time it's not going to be able to   do the job she's not going to be able to   do the job just look at her record but   forget her record not going to be able   to do the job she doesn't have a clue   Michigan has lost more than one in four   of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA a   deal signed by Bill Clinton and   supported by his lovely wife Hillary   by the way you know who I spotted in the   audience mayor Rudolph Giuliani   who needs you   [Applause]   he's got energy that guy he's all over   the place going from place to place the   place got a lot of energy a lot of a lot   of this up here to America has lost   listen to this 70000 factory 70000 not   700 not 7000 70000 factories   since China entered the World Trade   Organization   another Bill and Hillary backed disaster   we are living through the greatest jobs   theft in the history of the world   there's never been anything like this   our jobs are being stolen like candy   from a baby not going to happen anymore   folks they're going to be consequences   they're going to be when they fire our   people our great people who have been   working for 25 30 years of these   companies they fire our people there are   going to be consequences it doesn't work   that way not anymore and the politicians   have been working on this problem for 15   years for 20 years and it's so simple to   sell Delphi laid off three thousand six   hundred and twenty seven workers and   move their jobs to Mexico and other   countries FTE automotive laid off 166   workers in Auburn Hills beautiful place   and move their jobs to Mexico   chrysler later 5300 workers and move   their jobs to Mexico China and other   countries Ford later of 2155 workers and   move their jobs to Mexico and many other   countries now Ford is moving all of its   small car production to Mexico is that   wonderful it used to be the cars were   made in Flint and you couldn't drink the   water in Mexico now the cars are made in   Mexico and you can't drink the damn   water in Flint what   unbelievable   says that true though or what   unbelievable you know I have a friend   he's the biggest in the world at   building plants that's what he does he   builds plants you said build an   apartment he would know what to do he   builds plants the biggest plants and   there were most sophisticated plants all   kinds of plants I said how are you doing   east from this country loves his country   loves his whole area loves you people he   wants to do him here so I said to him   let me ask you how are you doing he said   unbelievable I said oh that's good   that's good   where are you doing well Mexico and so   what about our country not so good   he said Donald you have to see what   we're doing in Mexico we're building   some of the greatest plants anywhere in   the world and I said isn't this sad   isn't this pathetic we're going to   change it around   I want Mexico to build great plans but   we're going to build great plans also   it's got to be a two-way street folks   got to be a two-way street   and right now it's a one lane highway   right into these other countries they   take our money they take our jobs they   build their plants they build their   factories we end up with unemployment   and drugs that's what we end up with not   going to happen any longer a trump   administration will stop the jobs from   leaving America and we will stop the   jobs from leaving Michigan that I can   tell you 100%   if Ford or another company wants to fire   their workers in Michigan and move to   another country and ship their products   back into the United States I will pick   up the phone myself if I can't because I   love it they don't want me to do that   fault I want to do it it's so easy I   love doing it it's like I'm a natural   but I'll have plenty of great   representatives but we we I'm going to   do it every once in a while I don't care   because I love it   we'll be calling the executives at Ford   or whatever company is and we'll tell   them very nicely that if they want to   move their factory or their plan to   another country they will have to pay a   35% tax when they sell their cars or   their product back into the United   States through survey   powerful border so they'll pay attacks   and here's what's going to happen   100% nobody's moving folks they're not   gonna move they're not get a move okay   just think of it don't worry about it   we'll build the wall don't worry   a trump administration will renegotiate   NAFTA and if we don't get the deal we   want we will terminate NAFTA and get a   much better deal for our workers and our   companies a hundred percent we will also   immediately stop the job-killing   trans-pacific partnership which Hillary   Clinton called the gold standard and she   lied look she lied during the debate by   the way did Trump win the debate - Chuck   from the   and by the way he's here did Mike Pence   win the debate   man was that an easy the Bell wasn't   easy was it easy but he certainly made   it look easy didn't he how good is this   Cup Wow honestly I felt so sorry for tim   kaine that was like that was like a   great football team playing your local   high school football players so Hillary   lied about it she said it was the gold   standard and we caught her in the lie   and all of that but when you think about   it it is the gold standard it's the gold   standard for the other countries not for   us for the other countries we're doing   business with can't do it   Hillary will pass the TPP she will   absolutely pass it which will destroy   the rest of the auto industry believe me   it will just walk my words it will   destroy they don't even talk about   currency manipulation in TPP and they   didn't want to because it was taken out   because some of our politicians wanted   to take it out the number one weapon   they wanted to take it out because the   special interests take care of our   politician folks but they're not taking   care of me I've spent a fortune on this   campaign and I'll tell you I told this a   Mike Pence if we don't win because   everyone's saying unbelievable   unbelievable doesn't matter if you win   or lose has never been a movement like   this I said let me just tell you stop   right there   if we don't win this will be the single   greatest waste of time energy and money   in my life we have to win   to do what we have to do we have to win   we can't just have something that looks   wonderful in the history books in 30   years as part of our plan to bring back   jobs we are going to lower taxes on   American business from 35% to 15%   we will massively cut taxes for the   middle class Hillary Clinton wants to   raise your taxes very significantly   think of it we're the highest tax nation   in the world and she wants to raise your   taxes and we will rebuild our inner   cities I know so much about Detroit I   know so much about the inner cities the   african-american community the Hispanic   community has been treated horribly for   a long time the politicians in the case   of the inner cities virtually all   Democrats for over a hundred years   sometimes chained unbroken what they've   done is they come in they get your vote   and then they say see you for years I'll   see you in four years we're going to fix   our inner cities right now they're so   unsafe you walk to the store to pick up   a loaf of bread you get shot you get   shot you know in Chicago thousands and   thousands of shootings since January   first the inner cities are unbelievably   dangerous the education is no good the   safety is horrible and there are no jobs   and I tell everybody what the hell do   you have to lose I'm going to fix it we   will fix   [Applause]   morphix vice president Mike Pence will   be involved and he is so enthused about   this there is such potential we have   such potential in the people I'm talking   about the people there's such potential   there we will fix it remember that we   will become a rich nation once again but   to be a rich nation we must also be a   safe nation Hillary Clinton wants a five   hundred and fifty percent increase in   Syrian refugees pouring into our country   and virtually unlimited immigration from   the most dangerous regions of the world   including regions overrun and controlled   by Isis her plan will import generations   of terrorism extremism and radicalism   into your schools and throughout your   communities when I'm elected president   we will suspend the Syrian refugee   program and we will keep radical Islamic   terrorists the hell out of our   we have no choice we have no choice but   we all have big hearts and we will build   safe havens in Syria and we'll get the   Gulf states have nothing but money they   have nothing but money we will get them   to pay for we owe 20 trillion dollars   right now we're not going to pay for it   we're going to

caused with the refugee   problem with large numbers of poorly   vetted refugees pouring into your state   without your knowledge without your   support or without your approval nobody   even knows where people are being placed   a Drug Administration will not admit any   refugees without the support of the   local community where they're being   placed a Trump administration will also   secure and defend the borders of the   United States and yes we will build a   great great wall   [Applause]   so I just want to ask you one question   if you don't mind at one o'clock in the   morning who is going to pay for the wall   hundred-person they don't know it yet   but they're going to bed now we're gonna   have a great relationship with Mexico   but right now it's a one-way street we   can't have that we can't have that   they're going to pay for the wall   Hillary supports totally open borders   there goes your country and strongly   supports sanctuary cities like San   Francisco where Kate Steinle was   murdered by an illegal immigrant   deported at least five times a Trump   administration will end this nightmare   of violence and end it quickly we will   stop illegal immigration deport all   criminal aliens and dismantle every last   criminal gang in cartel threatening our   wonderful citizens we're going to   doing easily quickly   we will also repeal the obama-clinton   defense sequester and rebuild our badly   depleted military there haven't been   many times when we needed more I'm   honored to have the endorsement of more   than 200 top Admirals and Generals and   22 Medal of Honor recipients and that   list just grew a lot larger today   Hillary Clinton and our failed   establishment have dragged us into   foreign wars that have made us less safe   shift our wealth overseas to other   countries and left our borders at home   totally wide open that will change when   we win the presidency that will change   that will change   testitude it has to change

 [Music]   you   I   you   the   greatness of our country as the leader   of the free and unfree world has   vanished I've decided to do something   about it I couldn't stand to see what   was happening to our great country this   mask calls for leadership in the worst   way it needs someone with common sense   and business acumen someone who can   truly lead America back to what has made   us great in the past we need someone   with a proven track record in business   who understands greatness someone who   can rally us to the standard of   excellence we once epitomized I started   with the issue of illegal immigration   and proposed building a major wall that   would be very high and completely   impervious to the flood of immigrants   who we don't want or need here illegally   suddenly American started to wake up to   what was going on with regard to illegal   immigration despite the large number of   candidates who are running for the   Republican nomination what i was saying   started to really hit home with people i   started draw   very large crowd so that we   by raleys into football stadiums and   convention centers the first national   debate 224 million viewers which set a   record for cable television   all of a sudden people who had never   cared about the election were never   voted before   the rally's became massive the   were unbelievable the enthusiasm was   based on pure love and love of what we   were doing   the media the politicians and the   so-called leaders of our country reacted   in horror but I persevered and went   directly to the people because I don't   need anyone's financial support nor do I   need anyone's approval as to what to say   I just had to do the right thing I had   to do it I had no choice I see what's   happening to our country is going to   hell I had to   I've committed to a truly more powerful   military one prepared and equipped to   stand up to any and all of our foes when   we draw a line in the sand it needs to   mean something to all especially our   enemies   I released a tax plan that gives the   middle class   well rain comes   chance to keep more of what they earn   while restructuring how the richest   Americans   I've introduced a whole new approach to   job creation by encouraging companies to   bring more of their jobs and   manufacturing back to the United   along with the trillions of dollars   foreign banks overseas what we need is   leadership that can deal with our mess   and begin to apply practical   so much untapped greatness in our cut   together let's   make America great again I know people   have talked to you about whether or not   you want to run would you would you ever   I just probably wouldn't do it oh but i   probably wouldn't but i do get tired of   seeing what's happening with this   country and if I got so bad I would   never want to rule it out totally US   national debt currently stands at   eighteen point three trillion daughter   stopping the flood of fighters joining   Isis is much more   Oh   [Music]   I know thanks boy 3 well   [Applause]   a little bit different but you know you   lose a few jobs that's the problem one   the manufacturing is leaving stop   they're ripping us off like nobody has   ever ripped off the country don't worry   about an angan folks I'm looking at   these numbers you know before I leave   and honestly they're all pretty similar   the bridge one right I think maybe   you're a little bit worse bridgeport   region of Connecticut i always say give   me the stack so in bridgewater where are   you and you know as well that tremendous   victory   [Applause]   college boy impossible for me to get   over 50 don't forget fifty percent will   you have three people running the talk   and these characters in the media the   world's most is how most people they are   divorced I won South Carolina and one of   these things and you have these pundits   who are not that smart people and   they'll say and I had like 17 people   cope so at the beginning would have like   16 and 14 and 12 and I'd win and they   say Donald Trump did not get fifty   percent how do you get fifty percent   when you have all these people right and   even now we have three I call it too but   I really go and a half lions and cruises   at some   he's got no bears it's over because   statistically can't win anymore New York   you know it's nice when a place like New   York that knows we better than it at you   home right it's like if i lived in   bridgeport of somebody did a nasty story   the people that know me better than New   York people they bought it record   sixty-two percent almost   [Applause]   in all said well he has to get fifty   percent they thought they knew you   couldn't get because you have three   people running and but what was on the I   my Twitter I think 14 people and I did   very well i won what it says and I want   and then I hear the public who didn't   get over fit and a half senators and   governors and people like Ben Carson was   phenomenal by the way we did a really   smart guy and really smart people and   yeah 15 16 17 and then you win and they   say he didn't get thirty percent and   people don't think this evidence to bed   to hit I mean who can get it so now in   New York they didn't think rustling at   fifty percent we got almost sixty two   percent   [Applause]   elements 95 delegates we weren't almost   every delegate so I mean it was great so   what's happening is that not that proves   he has no pathway to victory other than   being a short seller is no pathway   different education has no he's he's 12   38 and he's running from this running   why you running I don't I'm just running   a lot of people a lot of people get   better than

 remember you remember this afternoon but   you have to remember or tuesday you have   to get up   you know very little to genetic and I'm   coming a lot together I don't take   anything we can't take anything for   granted I know the whole numbers running   go to forget the phone numbers because a   lot of times because they're all of   trumps cover when I love Trump   Easterwood when i run into though the   more we win by the better it's going to   be because we have a movement going on   it's being written about Bill O'Reilly   the other day but he said he biggest   political event to the effect that this   the Trump phenomenon and showing out the   Trump phenomena ditch you on the   phenomena believe out the nation set the   comfort of and now something to that   effect is the biggest political story   the most important political story of   his life   [Applause]   because I know and he's always brilliant   brilliant brilliant but but the truth is   and it's never an easy interview with   Bill I will tell you and he straight   down the middle he has no friendships no   nothing he goes right now that we've got   him and he said it he actually said it   twice because he said it the night   before to Bill O'Reilly but he said the   biggest political star in his lifetime   and he mentioned in that is the   assassination of John F Kennedy you know   which of course to be his big big and   horrible event and we've had some   horrible events in some very big events   so for him to say that it was a very big   steak and what he's saying please all   over when I go to Alabama we have 35000   people walk perhaps a much bigger than   version by the way and Bernie's over but   Bernie they make a couple of statements   should i need to say because we're going   to forget about Bernie then are not a   monthly your sandwich burning what else   unless Hilary gets her diamond which his   birdie birdie birdie said that she's not   qualified to be present I thought big   thing and then he pulled it back a   little bit cuz that's a tough sell you   know why he said I'll tell you where he   is right and did I happy when what   Bernie said he said she suffers from bad   judgment GSF pitches she want to go into   the water right I was against it by the   way and burning recently but she wanted   to go into the war in iraq and i said   it's going to absolutely destabilize the   Middle East if you do that and it was a   disaster and I was right you know they   talked about jumping stuff jumps going   to have a fast trigger but I won't have   a fest I'm probably gonna have to slow   his trigger of anybody but nobody's   going to mess with me   [Applause]   ever ever before and look at a take care   of our vets who have been absolutely   [Applause]   Oh   thank you sir they do an unbelievable   job you know that one incident that was   a mistake or you had a problem for   someone at a millions of people and   they'll put that incident on television   for weeks and weeks siblings and our   police are amazing   so this all began in q4 june six days   before i came down to trump tower and I   saw warming them it look like the   Academy Awards I said all the time they   look like the Academy Award and is that   something I wanted to do as up then I   put this great company I have a nice   life have a wonderful family my family   [Applause]   but putting an errand luncheon and   Milania they're all involved and they   love it and they love it because they   know   [Applause]   now that is really for me it was about   dragons and was about boars and it was   general just so many things actively   trade is so easy it's not like right in   my wheelhouse because I know whether   it's rich board or Albany where I was   last week Sarah kids poughkeepsie   Bethpage Long Island Alderaan Suffolk   County all places i love right places i   mean i had as much as eighty seven and   eighty-nine percent you mention getting   89% to have an overwhelming victory like   that where it was far greater than even   they know it was far away from the   people that really know you the best   okay they know me they know the good   command the other day no comment I grew   up there and I've been in so much pain   person so much was written about me   something corrected some you know   dishonest but but the people of New York   really know me so to have that kind of a   victory this way and it really shows a   lot to Pennsylvania and Maryland at   Rhode Island and Delaware and yourselves   where I mean Connecticut obviously knows   we Pennsylvania knows because I went to   school there and I went to school that's   of a great place great state but they   all have the same problems and then we   have problems where jobs are they   participated six million jobs that can   take it out of our country like so   easily some reason and we apologize have   been working on this problem for five   years they don't know what to do and   what we're going to do let's say we have   a company or british north coast of   mexico will go enjoy bridgeport employed   because you bet you're coming back and   what happens is this ideally want to see   these   before they leave nobody talks I don't   think everybody talks so when companies   leave I don't think people talk to if I   were doing it I'd say here's what it is   but the governors are alternatives they   need help from the federal government   and we have to impose a major tax on   these companies when they leave they go   to Mexico like our air-conditioned if   they go to Mexico and they think they're   going to sell their conditions back into   our country notes you a free trade free   trailer I believe in it a hundred   percent but not when you have stupid   partner negotiated your deals so I'm not   return my three trade beads you know the   new look at Mexico there people are   shocked their leaders a shopper dis   smarter what they do they kill interest   of the border killing us overboard I   that won't happen now we even beyond the   wall e the control if you look at the   border patrol today gave us last week   you probably saw first time in the   history of the Border Patrol they 16500   men and women endorsed Donald   [Applause]   sheriff joe arpaio he endorsed oh but   wouldn't have some work with what we   have to stop the drugs you know what I   want an action I go around will greet   people as my first Lakers I'm glove from   day one that this one and you see these   beautiful valleys and lakes the little   roads right into throat as beautiful but   people are incredible and I go into a   meeting and I say so what's the big   brother is a harrowing I say why don't   you just write it didn't it didn't mesh   with these beautiful trees that are your   heroine and then you go to other places   come here it's the same thing I mean I   know all about bridge would force okay   but you look it's coming in through the   South Dakota and I told the people   haven't you   [Applause]   stop Singapore is so tough on drug   dealers I mean this country I don't want   to have to tell you what are they doing   Singapore he said the hangar Singapore's   shut up for drug deals that people   wondering but see if word is so tough   and on a problem then I no problem   there's no games ok problem with us you   get caught once twice what like eight   times and then they start getting a   little bit tougher you can't sell   problems like that but I told the people   of New Hampshire then I tell South   Carolina went south carolina that wasn't   wants to be a stronghold protectors   which only one from meijer in his a liar   so i went with the evangelicals and i   wanted in the last row and I want   Louisiana and that's what I realized the   system's rigged because that one   Louisiana and I said oh I wasn't too   close to when we was him i was behind   and I was not supposed to win that was   supposed to be a ted cruz and remember   there are also other people there are   other people and again i'm doing with   some way and now i'm getting over fifty   percent with all these people now we   down to three final remember when they   say took those get over fifty percent i   was having 12 and 14 I want to spin karl   rove they assume   he was off like stuff and he was that   was he was trying to explain how the   fact that I wonder if you're part of the   greatest landslides anyone's ever seen   far right of that it wasn't really that   good it was an even the roses but even   he was like real in a hater the level of   hatred by the establishment of us is so   incredible it's so totally original   British a watch but what's these guys   and they were talking about the fifty   percent and he said again fifty percent   but this side and 61 or 62 percent you   can't say that anymore so he came up   with another narrative but when you   watch him struggling he's all nervous   and all crazy because this type of   insect was one of the biggest even   people that hate me said that was a   massive victory right and he's working   so hard to know what it doesn't read   that much you know I'm so ignored that   part and you see look folks the system's   rigged so what happens is Louisiana was   ticklish Ted Cruz was going to win the   South you know where all of a set   there's only one problem   [Applause]   I said before if I don't want to get   that it can i will read Alabama because   I'm telling the truth I 1 I 1 Alabama   one walking so we want places quit   Kentucky we won so many places Florida   was one of the greats were running a   shot right and I one messages or   something how about Massachusetts that's   pretty different okay but we have all   these victories and I said to people the   system I really found out about the rich   system elysium because I was behind I   wasn't supposed to live I was told over   and then a ball came out that over   several reports people I said hey let's   give it a shot so I went out there a   couple of times and the final line was a   Friday night and I made of speech and we   had an airplane hangar there was massive   like from Boeing 747 it was massive and   we said I'm coming to make your speech   the night before the election that   election took place i believe on a   saturday and i made a speech and the   people were unbelievable that it was   like a love dressed like this is it was   like a love   [Applause]   that's right involving a movement to the   comfort of time by the way they say it's   a movement like we've never had in the   history of our country it's true man   Charlie Lucia and I'm making this speech   and it was Emily and haha and the next   day they had the election and I one   reason i won again I wasn't supposed to   and he was supposed to when I was an   upset and I was it funny now a couple   weeks later they were editing up   different things that they're showing   how well with lurkers were winning a lot   of State said mostly muscle and then I   see let me show you better mistake I   said what no we didn't make a mistake   you made a mistake I want to stay easily   and you have this guy Chris having more   intelligence I want it I want Louise you   and they have cruise over here with what   that can't be possible how do you win it   and you don't get as the delegates go   I'll tell you it's a rig   so when i'm working with speeches he   can't win with the people we will get   decimated when they start doing negative   ads i had 55000 negative ends cases has   had one when they sucked if they put one   ad on casing whatever it's going to be   point but you know what happens i say so   how does this happen and then all of a   sudden animal is heavily would go to   sell for like nine ten pond all of a   sudden i realize is a radio because how   can you want to stay and get blessed   elements right now so we started   focusing and watch out the delegates and   pennsylvania levels okay but it's still   a bad system because when you win with a   popular vote and when you win stakes by   a lot with the popular vote you win that   stay anyway so what this guy's guys who   can't win for the popular vote because   he's got zero personality because he   lies like a thing   people probably paid for by super PAC   which is not supposed to be happening go   overlap why do you dining people taking   it out to dinner spending a lot of money   probably getting the motel rooms and   everything else where do you see we'll   figure it all out but i'll tell you why   it's really buying an election in this   country and you can't do headphone so   you're not allowed to prevent into an   interesting to see is the super PAC   doing it okay you're not supposed to be   doing it at this total communication i   would say so we're dealing with a broken   system we're dealing with a crooked   system like crooked Hillary and we're   dealing and we're dealing really do it   with a fixed field and we're going to   change it now the only way to keep that   at this stage but the only way to beat   is like the fighter said you know the   boxes i love the process i've always   liked the boxes to roll the dice   endorsement I want to get coffee night   I was behind I love up enough but Rosie   didn't do I love that honestly I like   the toughest I like the guys that are   tough because just something about and   they like me and that's what you want   folks because you know what the world is   tough the world is not so if the world   is stuff when I'm done this country is   knocked out our leaders are tough our   negotiators our representatives of not   tough Secretariat's they terrorists   the ring we need we need toughness you   know when Jeb Bush is to say I don't   like this tone my tongue they are   chopping off people's heads in the   lilies they're drowning people at steel   cages and Jeff dosage I like dark rum   stop   I don't have
