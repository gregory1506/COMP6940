      "you you wow thi is beauti we just kept drive and drive and drive were pretti far up and i said that a great group of peopl thi is what it all about these are the peopl that built our countri who watch the debat last night but yeah it wa good right it wa good we had a lot of fun we gave veri high grade and they even peopl that hate me gave me good mark isnt that amaz some of those punter they hate me so much and it wa so hard one of them said he won the debat i cant stand it i cant stand it they were almost they were almost cri you know one of the thing that wa interest and it came across even more so on televis last night wa the room wa load up i think they had like a thousand seat which is it a veri big room that far less than the peopl we have tonight today but they had let say a thousand and they were suppos to have the young peopl from the colleg and what happen is all the rich donor and special interest and the lobbyist got all the ticket right hmm boo boo oh and i know so mani of im look at the fact see these peopl theyr a lot of money tremend money by the way in that room last night but im look at these peopl those angri face and theyr look at me how could you do thi to us so and you saw where i complain i said all these peopl theyr give bush she just wast money he just wast it he take it whi dont you just throw it out the window you should what they should do is give it to the vet that would be realli nice okay right but a guy like bush he got 128 million dollar ive never seen it it at the bottom of the pack and just it just a total it alway such a wast well actual it not a wast becaus all of those handler that he got make a lot of money you know they make a lot of money so what you what you do is im look at the room and i see special interest guy i see peopl that repres the insur compani the oil compani the drug compani that whi we pay so much you know the drug you know what happen with the drug right so for medicar and other thing were the largest per sir of drug in the world prescript drug and other drug to make peopl better fine and with the largest and yet we buy for practic the same price if you go to the local drug store and take someth off the counter that what we pay you know peopl say do you think you can find ani wast to the countri how about like you wont believ what were go to find thi is just one thing out of mani so if you go to the drug store and pick up a drug it not that much differ in price becaus were not allow for some reason i dont know what the reason is i do know what the reason is but i dont know how they can sell it were not allow to negoti drug price can you believ it so we buy drug biggest in the world and we pay about 300 billion dollar more that were suppos to if we negoti the price so there 300 billion on day one we saw now here a differ in the room last night you had repres of drug compani they are give money to numer of these peopl like the head of johnson amp; johnson is jeb bush top fundrais so i mean tell me so let me ask you do you think jeb bush is go to make drug price competit when and he a good guy it woodi johnson he a friend of mine he a great guy but woodi johnson is the head of jeb bush fundrais thing so let say jeb won which is an imposs it not gonna happen but let say but thi appli to everybodi els let say jeb won woodi johnson of johnson amp; johnson is the head of hi own how is it possibl for jeb in all fair to jeb to say what are you were go to go out and fight competit your talk about billion and billion of dollar that they wont collect that theyr collect right now in profit and that the way our countri work folk so what happen is i made the announc last night that in the room you know what happen a lot of the kid they were suppos to have like seven or eight hundr pass for kid and i blame the rnc for thi i mean i think it terribl what happen last night i want ticket like they said you have 20 ticket 20 ticket im the one that brought all the action right am i the one i mean if these other guy came up here today that befor peopl in the front row the owner of the build it wasnt even meant for thi he said thi is the biggest crowd weve ever had so what happen is we i thought it wa a protest it a friend i love protest becaus the camera follow they wont follow it except for that so it not possibl that you know you look at it and you see the kind of money your talk about but so im a self funder im put up my own money right that a nice thing im way under budget im way under budget you know right now im 40 million made closer that may be 50 but im 40 million dollar under budget is that nice think of it im 40 million dollar under budget and im number one in the poll all right a guy like jeb ha spent a hundr and ten million dollar and he down in the boon you know just he down here can you imagin it i mean it just that not what the countri we got to get the guy i give the exampl of educ in the world in the world were rank number 30 but were number one and cost per pupil by a lot number two is like so far down they dont even consid it number two so we are by far the most expens and yet we have with number 30 we have third world countri that do better than us now you have sweden and norway and denmark and china in the top four or five right but were number 30 and yet we spend more now wouldnt it be nice if you could take a look at what im do here if we could spend less and be one or two or five or someth you know now one of the reason we do so badli is common core common core is a disast common core is a complet disast so we get rid of that and we start educ your children in new hampshir well local i mean the peopl they hate common core but they dont hate it becaus theyr bad peopl or theyr hater theyr not hater theyr hidden for a differ reason it no good who want to have a bureaucrat in washington take care and educ your kid we dont want it you want to have local educ and ive seen it and ive watch it it beauti the parent and they have the children and they their board and it so beauti and then by the way their children graduat they say on the board becaus they love the school becaus their children went there that what you have to have it so import so we want to be at a point where we can spend less money and have a far stronger countri and a better countri i look at militari expenditur you know im go to build the militari bigger better stronger and i guarante we can do it for less money you know i hear stori like you know theyr order missil that they dont want becaus of polit becaus of special interest becaus the compani that make the missil is a contributor and the other compani that make the missil that arent good isnt so were order missil that the gener dont want becaus of polit so here

bring our job back you know you got strip in new hampshir you got absolut strip but one of the thing i hear new hampshir so much and it shock ive heard a look for a long time now but but shock becaus you drive through the beauti wood area beauti it a beauti place it one of the most beauti place youll ever see and it a tremend it sure there a love for it and there a great spirit in new hampshir if there a great spirit but one of the problem and it just doesnt seem to go and that whi it so surpris to me mayb it make more of an impress the heroin problem the the drug problem and all of the stuff that pour in is is incred i mean the drug come into new hampshir is just incred and when im with when im with peopl when i you know when i i come out and im with group you know usual if peopl will talk about like let talk about the militari which they do talk about and they talk about the vet we have al balda uhoh there it is okay oh the owner wa such a nice guy saw him i said oh if thi mic doesnt id like it if the mic didnt work you know whi i could say well that all we can go folk and be buzz you know were not go to pay the rent right were not go to give the room see now the countri would pay the rent of it mic didnt work if the mic doesnt work for me i say sorri im not pay anyth right so anyway but we have a land we have so mani of the peopl from the vet but the thing that i hear more than anyth els in term of new hampshir problem is the drug problem and you just dont associ it with new hampshir but they have a tremend problem it pour across from larg from the southern border and were go to put that wall up and your not go to have that problem and we got to take the peopl that are addict and badli badli badli addict and were go to were go to work to get them better and then you know it interest it interest with the drug thing and alcohol and other addict but if you dont start it realli easi to solv okay it like smoke if you never smoke a cigarett you dont have a problem quit if you never start take the drug your not go to have a problem and when we make it so hard for them to get into the countri beyond even new hampshir becaus were go to have that wall that wall is go to be so big and so strong and so power and were go to have our border guard were go to have our border guard you know a coupl of these politician that im deal with the politician they said to me about two month ago they said you cant realli build a wall donald can you of caus it well i built build at a 94 storey tall wall you know i may give me a break and and and itll be a nice wall beauti itll be a big wall a beauti wall and were go to name it trump someday mayb right so we have to make it real no i dont want it but but it will be a power wall and i alway talk about they right now they have these wall where they build ramp i never understood they build ramp go over these littl wall right you know we have wall alreadi littl wall i call them the littl babi wall and they build ramp and they have these truck drive truck drive right over the ramp over the wall and down load it up with drug they drop the drug off all over the countri then they come back over the ramp i said whi dont they just knock the wall down it a littl wall i never understood whi did they buy that you know whi do they do the ramp i guess mayb they want to be nice to us they dont want to do ani destruct right so we end up get the drug and they end up get the money not gonna happen that way anymor folk not go to happen that way so when i say im go to build a wall these politician come up to me and theyr wellmean but theyr politician they dont know anyth that i mean honestli they know one thing how to get reelect that what they know theyr good at that and the way they get reelect is all those guy in the audienc last night take care of them and the drug compani guy make sure that you never negoti the price of drug and the oil guy make sure that all good thing happen with respect to oil right and all of these thing it the way the system work becaus i wa on the other side of the system for a long time and a veri big donor and i understand it but when you have the insur compani you look at insur health insur the reason we have the line the artifici line around each state is becaus the health insur compani to come the insur compani want to have it that way becaus theyd rather have monopoli in each state than have hundr of compani go all over the place bid so that we can get our price way way way down becaus obamacar is a disast and it expens and it no good and it doesnt work so the insur compani say they were in the room i saw him last night i know these peopl the insur compani say listen i want to take new york you take new you take some other place you take iowa you take some other place i want california person california is veri good but they have line around the state okay and new hampshir is the same thing and for those of you that own busi is veri hard to get mani competit bid so what the adjourn compani do is they say id rather have new hampshir and not have a lot of bid then have the right to bid all over the unit state right one problem you cant make a good deal so hard for me to make deal i have thousand of employe so hard for me to make deal on health care becaus i cant get bid alright now onc we get rid of the line itll be easi whi cant we get rid of the line becaus the insur compani give tremend polit contribut to the guy that im on the stage with so whether it the insur compani that the drug compani in the oil compani it all the same thing were never go to get our countri back if we keep do thi were never go to get it back i tell the stori and to me it a great you know i could use ani one of a hundr differ place probabl much more than that but were ford move you know theyr build their big plant and theyr build it in mexico and theyr close a lot of plant theyr build a two and a half billion dollar automobil plant truck automobil and part two and a half billion in mexico and i say how is that good how is that good for us look new hampshir know better than anyon becaus youv lost a lot of busi to mexico okay you know i see these place now that are some are empti and some are convert to senior citizen some are convert to apart but in the meantim you need job you dont necessarili need the apart you need job and your take the job out your give them to other countri and were go to end that were not go to let it continu to happen were not go to have ani job you look at manufactur right now look at caterpillar tractor it a great great compani but if you look at what japan is do with their currenc the yen theyr drop the hell out of it theyr devalu their currenc to such a point that komatsu is knock the hell out of caterpillar we have to say your go to do that we dont want your car okay they wont believ it except if im the messeng you got to have the right messeng but you got to have the right messeng you know see the problem is we have peopl that dont know the first thing about negoti realli busi but common sens but it negoti these peopl are rank amateur they are i dont want to say what i am i refut ill get in troubl see those peopl see all those camera back there theyv never driven so far to get to a locat of their life but you see all those camera back there but it realli true uh we have tremend power becaus china is suck us dri and without us china weve rebuilt china theyv taken our job our base thousand of million of job by the way not thousand million and million of job thousand

have thi massiv place in china and theyr not gonna have to build their plane here anymor so how doe it help us it go to be a whole differ ballgam so we have a lot of power over these over these countri now when japan take their yen they have a veri strong leader veri smart leader one of their best leader in a long time when japan ill get along with them great hell like me i like him but ill just say listen name is abbey were not go to be abl your not go to be abl to rip us off anymor it okay dont worri about hell respect us more i have the biggest bank in the world as a tenant one of my

to lead our countri anyon who cannot condemn that hate oppress and violenc of radic islam lack the moral clariti to serv as our presid the rise of isi is the direct result of polici decis made by presid obama and secretari of state clinton let look back at the middl east at the veri begin of 2009 befor the obama clinton administr took over libya wa stabl syria wa under control egypt wa rule by a secular presid and an alli of the unit state iraq wa experienc a reduct in violenc but group that would becom what we now call isi wa close to be extinguish iran wa be choke off by econom sanction fast forward to today what we have and think of thi and the decis made by the obamaclinton group have been absolut disast libya and ruin our ambassador three other realli brave american are dead and isi ha gain a new base of oper syria is in the midst of a disastr civil war isi control larg portion of territori a refuge crisi now threaten europ and the unit state in egypt terrorist have gain a foothold in the sinai desert near the suez canal one of the most essenti waterway the world iraq is in chao and isi is on the loos isi ha spread across the middl east and into the west in 2014 isi wa oper in seven nation in seven nation terribl but that what it wa to day they are fulli oper in 18 countri with aspir branch and six more for a total of 24 and mani believ that number is actual 28 to 30 countri they dont even know the situat is like wors than the public ha ani idea a new congression report reveal that the administr ha downplay the growth of isi with forti percent of analyst say they have experienc effort to manipul their find and tri to make it look much better than it is it bad at the same time isi is tri to infiltr refuge flow into europ and to the unit state iran the world largest state sponsor of terror is now flush with 150 billion dollar in cash releas by the unit state plu if you rememb from two week ago anoth 400 million in actual cash that wa obvious use for ransom worst of all the nuclear deal put iran the number one state sponsor of radic islam terror on a path to nuclear weapon ensur the obamaclinton foreign polici ha unleash isi destabil the middl east and put the nation of iran which chant death to america in a domin posit of region power and in fact aspir to be a domin world power it all began in 2009 with what ha becom known as presid obama global apolog tour we all rememb in a seri of speech presid obama describ america arrog dismiss deris and a coloni power he wa describ us he inform other countri that he would be speak up about america past error he pledg that we would no longer be a senior partner than sought to dictat our term he lectur cia offic of the need to acknowledg their mistak and describ guantanamo bay as a ralli cri for our enemi perhap no speech wa more misguid than presid obama speech to the muslim world deliv in cairo egypt 2009 i rememb it well in win the cold war presid ronald reagan repeatedli tout the superior of freedom communist and call the ussr the evil empir yet when presid obama deliv hi address in cairo no such moral courag could be found or would be found instead of condemn the oppress of women and gay in mani muslim nation and the systemat violat of human right or the financ of global terror presid obama tri to draw an equival between our human right record and rememb thi our human right and there the record are unbeliev and unmistak hi naiv word were follow by even more naiv action the failur to establish a new statu of forc agreement interact and the elect driven timet for withdraw surrend our game in that countri and led directli to the rise of isi without question the failur in iraq were compound by hillari clinton disast total disast in libya presid obama ha sinc said that he regret and realli regret libya and the mistak he made he consid it hi worst mistak accord to then secretari of defens robert gate the invas of libya wa nearli a split decis but hillari clinton forc advocaci for the intervent wa the decid factor that whi we went in with one episod of bad judgment after anoth hillari clinton polici launch isi onto the world stage yet as she threw the middl east into violent turmoil thing turn out realli to be not so hot for our world and our countri the middl east in particular that clinton made almost 60 million dollar in gross incom while she wa secretari of state it is unbeliev incid after incid prove again and again hillari clinton lack the judgment as said by berni sander stabil and tempera and the moral charact to lead our nation importantli she also lack the mental and physic stamina to take on isi and all of the mani adversari we face not onli in terror but in trade and everi other challeng we must confront to turn our great countri around it is now time for a new approach our current strategi of nation build and regim chang is a proven absolut failur we have creat the vacuum that allow terror to grow and thrive i wa an oppon of the iraq war from the begin a major differ between me and my oppon though i wa a privat citizen whose person opinion on such matter were realli not sought by nonetheless publicli express my privat doubt about the invas i wa against believ me three month befor the invas i said in an interview with neil cavuto to whom i offer my best wish for a speedi recoveri that quot perhap we shouldnt be do it yet and that the economi is a much bigger problem in august of 2004 veri earli right after the conflict i made a detail statement to esquir magazin and an interview here is the quot in full look at the war in iraq and the mess were in i would never have handl it that way thi wa right after the invas doe anybodi realli believ that iraq is go to be a wonder democraci where peopl are go to run down to the vote box and gentli put in their ballot and the winner is happili go to go and step up and lead the countri come on i then continu two minut after we leav it go to be a revolut and the meanest toughest smartest most viciou guy in thi case guy will take over and hell have weapon of mass destruct which saddam hussein did not happen what wa the purpos of thi whole thing hundr and hundr of young peopl kill and what about the peopl come back with no arm and no leg not to mention it all fair the other side the tremend damag done all those araki kid whove been blown to piec and it turn out that all of the reason for the war were blatantli wrong all of thi death and destruct for noth so ive been clear for a long time that we should not have gone in but i have been just as clear in say what a catastroph mistak hillari clinton and presid obama made with the reckless way in which they pull out after we had made those hardfought sacrific and game we should have never made such a sudden withdraw on a timet advertis to our enemi they said were move out here our time here our day who would do thi but an incompet presid al qaeda in iraq had been decim and obama and clinton david new life and allow it to spread all across the world by that same token presid obama and hillari clinton should have never attempt to build a democraci in libya to push for immedi regim chang in syrian or to support the overthrow of mubarak in egypt one more point on thi i have long said that we should have kept the oil in iraq i set it over and over and over again anoth area what my judgment ha been proven correct i just said it so mani time virtual everi time i wa interview keep the oil keep the oil accord to cnn isi made as much as 500 million in oil sale in 2014 alon that befor they realli got start fuel and fund it rain of terror if we had control the oil like i said we should we could have prevent the rise of isi in iraq both by cut off a major sourc of fund and through the presenc of us forc necessari to safeguard the oil and vital infrastructur product necessari for us to have you know i wa say thi constantli and consist to whoever would listen i said keep the oil keep the oil keep the oil dont let somebodi els get it they had listen to me then we would have had the econom benefit of the oil which i want to use to help take care of the wound soldier and famili of those who die in the war in addit to which thousand of live would have been save thi propos by it veri natur would have left soldier in place of our essenc we would have had soldier there guard thi valuabl suppli of oil in the old day when we want to warn to the victor belong thi boy instead all we got from iraq and our adventur in the middl east wa death destruct and tremend financi loss but it time to put the mistak of the past behind us in chart a new cours and i becom presid the era of nation build will be brought to a veri swift and decis a new approach which must be share by both parti in america by our alli oversea and by our friend in the middl east must be to halt the spread of radic islam all action should be orient around the skull and ani countri which share thi goal will be our alli veri import some dont share hi goal we cannot alway choos our friend but we can never fail to recogn our enemi as presid i will call for intern confer focus on thi goal we will work sidebysid with our friend in the middl east includ our greatest alli israel we will partner with king abdullah of jordan and the presid of egypt presid sisi and all mother who recogn thi ideolog of death that must be extinguish we will also work veri close with nato on thi new mission i had previous said that nato wa obsolet becaus it fail to deal adequ with terror sinc my comment they have chang their polici and now have a new divis focus on terror threat veri good veri veri good i also believ that we could find common ground with russia in the fight against isi wouldnt that be a good thing they too have much at stake in the outcom in syria and have had their own battl with islam terror just as bad as our they have a big big problem in russia with isi my administr will aggress pursu joint and coalit militari oper to crush and destroy isi intern cooper to cut off their fund expand intellig share and cyber warfar to distrust and disabl their propaganda and recruit their recruit is take place right now and theyr set record it got to be stop we cannot allow the internet to be use as a recruit tool and for other purpos by our enemi we must shut down there access to thi form of commun and we must do it immedi immedi unlik hillari clinton who is risk so mani live with her careless handl of sensit inform my administr will not telegraph exactli militari plan and what they are and by the way what happen with her 33000 email is an absolut disgrac for the unit state ive often said that the great gener dougla macarthur and a great gener georg patton would be in a state of shock if they were aliv today to see the way presid obama and hillari clinton tri to recklessli announc their everi move befor it happen like they did in iraq so that the enemi can prepar and adapt their enemi si thank you the fight will not be limit to isi we will decim al qaeda and we will seek to starv punter for a ran back to mosqu and hezbollah so import we can use exist un secur council resolut to appli new and even stronger sanction militari cyber and financi warfar will all be necessari to dismantl islam terror but we must use ideolog warfar as well veri import and they use it on us better than we have ever even thought of use it on them but that will chang just as we won thank you just as we won the cold war part by expos the evil of commun and the virtu of free market so too must we take on the ideolog of radic islam while my oppon accept million of dollar in foundat donat from countri where be gay is an offens punish by prison or death my administr will speak out against the oppress of women gay and peopl of differ belief our administr would be a friend to all moder muslim reform in the middl east and will amplifi their voic thi includ speak out against a horribl practic of honor kill where women are murder by their rel for dress marri or act in a way that violat fundamentalist teach over 1000 pakistani girl are estim to be the victim of honor kill by their rel each year recent a promin pakistani social media star wa strangl to death by her brother on the charg of dishonour the famili in hi confess the brother took pride in the murder and said girl are born to stay home and follow tradit shockingli thi is a practic that ha reach our own shore on such case and mani mani case have happen but one involv an iraqi immigr who wa sentenc to 34 year in jail for run over hi own daughter claim she had been too western to defeat islam terror we must also speak out forc against a hate ideolog that provid the breed ground for violenc and terror to grow it a breed ground it a terribl terribl breed ground a new immigr polici is need immedi as well the common thread link the major islam terrorist attack that have recent occur on our soil 911 the fort hood shoot the boston bomb the san bernardino attack the orlando attack is that they have involv immigr or the children of immigr clearli new screen procedur are need a review by the us senat immigr subcommitte ha identifi 380 foreignborn individu charg with terror or terrorismrel offens between 911 and 2014 and mani more sinc then and thi year is a record for identif it gotten wors far wors we also know that isi recruit refuge after their entranc into the countri as we have seen with the somali refuge popul in minnesota beyond terror as we have also seen in franc foreign popul have brought their antisemit attitud with them in cologn germani on new year eve we have seen the report of sexual violenc and assault far greater than anybodi know pew poll show that in mani of the countri from which we draw a larg number of immigr extrem view about religion such as the death penalti and for those who are involv the death penalti is veri veri common if you dont have the faith that they demand you have a trumpet administr will establish a clear principl that will govern all decis pertain to immigr and we will be tough and we will conclud we should onli admit into thi countri those who share our valu and respect our peopl in the cold war we had an ideolog screen test the time is overdu to develop a new screen test for the threat we face today i call it extrem vet i call it extrem extrem vet our countri ha enough problem we dont need more and these are problem like weve never in addit to screen out all member of the sympath of terrorist group we must also screen out ani of hostil attitud toward our countri or it principl or who believ that sharia law should supplant american those who do not believ in our constitut or who support bigotri and hatr will not be admit for immigr into our countri onli those that we expect to flourish in our countri and to embrac a toler american societi should be issu visa to put these new procedur in place we will have to temporarili suspend immigr from some of the most danger and volatil region of the world that have a histori of export terror not for us not for us as soon as i take offic i will ask the state depart and the depart of homeland secur to identifi a list of region where adequ screen cannot take place there are mani such region we will stop process visa from those area until such time as it is deem safe to resum base on new circumst or new procedur the size of current immigr flow are simpli too larg to perform adequ scream we had been about 100000 perman immigr from the middl east everi year beyond that we admit hundr of thousand of temporari worker and visitor from the same region hundr of thousand if we dont control the number we cant perform adequ screen there no way it can take us by contrast my oppon want to increas which is unbeliev no matter who you are no matter where you come from want to increas the flow of syrian refuge by five hundr and fifti percent over what they are now the unit state senat subcommitte on immigr estim that hillari clinton plan would mean roughli six hundr and twenti thousand refuge from all current refuge send nation in her first term assum no cut to other refuge program so it could get wors thi would be addit to all other non refuge immigr unbeliev number unbeliev number the subcommitte estim a plan would impos a lifetim cost of roughli 400 billion dollar when you includ the cost of health care well fair hous school and all other entitl benefit that are exclud from the state depart placement figur think of thi 400 billion dollar insur hillari clinton want to be america angela merkel and you know what a disast thi massiv immigr ha been to germani and the peopl of germani crime ha risen to level that no one thought they would have biliti and strangl i mean we have enough problem in our countri we dont need more lastli we will need to restor common sens to our secur procedur anoth common featur of the past attack that are occur on our soil is that warn sign were total ignor the 911 hide you had fraud all over their visa applic almost everi one of them it said practic in big bold letter fraud and nobodi saw the russian warn us about the boston bomber here on polit zone and the attack were even twice interview by the fbi veri said the femal san bernardino shooter owner vient there are her statement and everyth that she said she wa here on a fianc visa which most peopl never even heard of from saudi arabia and she want to support veri openli jihad onlin those are the peopl were taken in a neighbor so suspici behavior bomb of the floor and other thing but didnt warn author becaus they said they didnt want to be accus of racial profil now mani are dead and mani more are grave wound the shooter in orlando reportedli celebr in hi classroom after 911 he too wa interview by the fbi hi father nativ of afghanistan support the oppress taliban regim and express antiamerican view veri strongli and by the way wa just seen sit behind hillari clinton with a big fat smile on hi face all the way through her space he obvious like what she had to say it call weak weak call stupid and we the fort hood shooter deliv a present to a room full of mental health expert befor the attack in which he threw out one red flag after anoth he even proclaim that we love death more than you love life not good these warn sign were ignor becaus polit correct ha replac common sens in our thank you that is whi one of my first access presid will be to establish a commiss on radic islam which will includ reformist voic in the muslim commun who will hope work

togeth again our victori in the cold war reli on a bipartisan and intern consensu that is what we must have to defeat radic islam terrorist but just like we couldnt defeat commun without acknowledg that commun exist were explain it horribl evil we cant defeat radic islam terror but unless we do the exact same thing we have to explain varianc and explain a veri difficult day we have to have a

      "good afternoon good afternoon thank you veri much thank you veri much great to be here in virginia thank you all for be here it an extraordinari troubl time for our countri and the reason it so troubl is that we have a nation that today feel more divid than at ani time in my lifetim and were divid in larg measur becaus our leader are not provid the type of clariti about what are the import prioriti that the peopl want our countri to be pursu the first and most import thing to me not onli as a governor but more importantli as a husband and a father is the safeti and the secur of my famili and i respect you feel the same way and that safeti and secur is not just about be safe and secur from threat outsid thi countri it about make sure that we are safe and secur from threat of violenc from within our countri as well we need a presid who onc again well put law and order at the top of the prioriti of the presid in thi countri our polic offic the men and women who stand each day to protect us need to understand that the presid of the unit state and hi administr will give them the benefit of the doubt not alway believ that what theyv done is somehow wrong we need to stand behind the men and women in blue in thi countri i spent seven year as a member of law enforc as the unit state attorney in new jersey and dure those year the presid i serv made it veri clear to us that our first job wa to protect the safeti and secur of the american peopl and that everi other prioriti while import fell in behind that we need onc again to have a presid who put the safeti and secur of our citizen first and doe not blink or hesit to take the strong action that need to be taken to make sure that those both at home and around the world know that lawless will not be toler from anyon no matter how power or lack of power that those peopl may have one order need to be the first prioriti onc again in our in our countri and in thi come elect there can be littl question about where law and order stand and where lawless stand the fact is that we have the spectacl last week of watch a director of the fbi twice in one week repeatedli say that the democrat nomine for presid

we are keep the promis i made to american peopl dure my campaign for presid whether it cut jobkil regul appoint and confirm a tremend suprem court justic put in place tough new ethic rule achiev a record reduct in illeg immigr on our southern border were bring job plant and factori back into the unit state at number which no one until thi point thought even possibl and believ me weve just begun the fruit of our labor will be seen veri shortli even more so when these issu and so mani more were follow through on our commit and i dont want anyth to get in our way i am fight everi day for the great peopl of thi countri therefor in order to fulfil my solemn duti to protect america and it citizen the unit state will withdraw from the pari climat accord thank you thank you but begin negoti to reenter either the pari accord or in realli entir new transact when term that are fair to the unit state it busi it worker it peopl it taxpay so were get out but we will start to negoti and we will see if we can make a deal that fair and if we can that great and if we cant that fine as presid i can put no other consider befor the wellb of american citizen the pari climat accord is simpli the latest exampl of washington enter into an agreement that disadvantag the unit state to the exclus benefit of other countri leav american worker who i love and taxpay to absorb the cost in term of lost job lower wage shutter factori and vastli diminish econom product thu as of today the unit state will ceas all implement of the nonbind pari accord and the draconian financi and econom burden the agreement impos on our countri thi includ end the implement of the nation determin contribut and veri importantli the green climat fund which is cost the unit state a vast fortun complianc with the term of the pari accord and the owner energi restrict that is place on the unit state could cost america as much as 27 million lost job by 2025 accord to the nation econom research associ thi includ four hundr and forti thousand fewer manufactur job not what we need believ me thi is not what we need includ automobil job and the further decim of vital american industri on which countless commun reli they reli for so much and we would be give them so littl accord to the same studi by 2040 complianc with the commit put into place by the previou administr would cut product for the follow sector paper down 12 cement down 23 iron and steel down 38 coal and i happen to love the coal miner down 86 percent natur ga down 31 the cost of the economi at thi time would be close to three trillion dollar in lost gdp and six and a half million industri job while household would have 7000 less incom and in mani case much wors than that not onli doe thi deal subject our citizen to harsh econom restrict it fail to live up to our environment ideal as someon who care deepli about the environ which i do i cannot in good conscienc support a deal that punish the unit state which is what it doe the world leader in environment protect while impos no meaning oblig on the world lead pollut for exampl under the agreement china will be abl to increas these emiss by a stagger number of year 13 they can do whatev they want for 13 year not us india make it particip conting on receiv billion and billion and billion of dollar in foreign aid from develop countri there are mani other exampl but the bottom line is that the pari accord is veri unfair at the highest level to the unit state further while the current agreement effect block the develop of clean coal in america which it doe and the mine are start to open up have a big open in two week pennsylvania ohio west virginia in so mani place a big open of a brandnew mine it unheard of for mani mani year that hasnt happen they ask me if id go im go to tri china will be allow to build hundr of addit coal plant so we cant build the plant but they can accord to thi agreement india will be allow to doubl it coal product by 2020 think of it india can doubl their coal product were suppos to get rid of our even europ is allow to continu construct of coal plant in short the agreement doesnt elimin coal job it just transfer those out of america and the unit state and ship them to foreign countri thi agreement is less about the climat and more about other countri gain a financi advantag over the unit state the rest of the world applaud when we sign the pari agreement they went wild they were so happi for the simpl reason that it put our countri the unit state of america which we all love at a veri veri big econom disadvantag a cynic would say the obviou reason for econom competitor and they wish to see us remain in the agreement is so that we continu to suffer thi selfinflict major econom wound we would find it veri hard to compet with other countri from other part of the world we have among the most abund energi reserv on the planet suffici to lift million of america poorest worker out of poverti yet under thi agreement we are effect put these reserv under lock and key take away the great wealth of our nation it great wealth it phenomen well not so long ago we had no idea we had such wealth and leav million and million of famili trap in poverti and jobless the agreement is a massiv redistribut of unit state wealth to other countri at 1 growth renew sourc of energi can meet some of our domest demand but at 3 or 4 percent growth which i expect we need all form of avail american energi or our countri will be a grave risk of brownout and blackout our busi will come to a halt in mani case and the american famili will suffer the consequ in the form of lost job and a veri diminish qualiti of life even if the pari agreement were implement in full with total complianc from all nation it is estim it would onli produc a twotenth of one degre think of that thi much celsiu reduct in global temperatur by the year 2100 tini tini amount in fact 14 day of carbon emiss from china alon would wipe out the gain from america and thi is incred statist would total wipe out the gain from america expect reduct in the year 2030 after we have had to spend billion and billion of dollar lost job close factori and suffer much higher energi cost for our busi and for our home as the wall street journal wrote thi morn the realiti is that withdraw is in america econom interest and wont matter much to the climat the unit state under the trump administr will continu to be the cleanest and most environment friendli countri on earth will be the cleanest than have the cleanest air were go to have the cleanest water we will be environment friendli but were not go to put our busi out of work were not go to lose our job were go to grow im go to grow rapidli and i think you just read it just came out minut ago the small busi report small busi as if just now are boom hire peopl one of the best report theyv seen in mani year im will to immedi work with democrat leader to either negoti our way back into pari under the term that are fair to the unit state and it worker or to negoti a new deal that protect our countri and it taxpay so if the obstructionist want to get togeth with me let make them non obstructionist we will all sit down and we will get back into the deal and well make it good and we wont be close up our factori and we wont be lose our job and well sit down with the democrat and all of the peopl that repres either the pari accord or someth that we can do that much better than the pari accord and i think the peopl of our countri will be thrill and i think then the peopl of the world will be thrill but until we do that were out of the agreement i will work to ensur that america remain the world leader on environment issu but under a firm work that is fair and where the burden and respons are equal share among the mani nation all around the world no respons leader can put the worker and the peopl of their countri at thi debilit and tremend disadvantag the fact that the parasteel hamstr the unit state while empow some of the world top pollut countri should dispel ani doubt as to the real reason whi fahren lobbyist wish to keep our magnific countri tie up and bound down by thi agreement it to give their countri an econom edg over the unit state that not go to happen while im presid im sorri my job as presid is to do everyth within my power to give america a level play field and to creat the econom regulatori and tax structur that make america the most prosper and product countri on earth and with the highest standard of live and the highest standard of environment protect our tax bill is move along in congress and i believ it do veri well i think a lot of peopl will be veri pleasantli surpris the republican are work veri veri hard wed love to have support from the democrat but we may have to go it alon but it go veri well the pari agreement handicap the unit state economi in order to win prais from the veri foreign capit and global activist that have long sought to gain wealth at our countri expens they dont put america first i do and i alway will the same nation ask us to stay in the agreement are the countri that have collect cost america trillion of dollar through tough trade practic and in mani case lack contribut to our critic militari allianc you see what happen it pretti obviou to those that want to keep an open mind at what point doe america get demean at what point do they start laugh at us as a countri we want fair treatment for it citizen and we want fair treatment for our taxpay we dont want other leader and other countri laugh at us anymor and they wont be they wont be i wa elect to repres the citizen of pittsburgh not pari i promis i would exit or renegoti ani deal which fail to serv america interest mani trade deal will soon be under renegoti veri rare do we have a deal that work for thi countri but theyll soon be under renegoti the process ha begun from day one but now were down to busi beyond the sever energi restrict inflict by the pari accord it includ yet anoth scheme to redistribut wealth out of the unit state through the so call green climat fund nice name which call for develop countri to send 100 billion dollar to develop countri all on top of america exist and massiv foreign aid payment so were go to be pay billion and billion and billion of dollar and were alreadi way ahead of anybodi els mani of the other countri havent spent anyth and mani of them will never pay one dime the green fund would like oblig the unit state to commit potenti ten of billion of dollar of which the unit state ha alreadi hand over 1 billion dollar nobodi els is even close most of them havent even paid anyth includ fund raid out of america budget for the war against terror that where they came believ me they didnt come from me they came just befor i came into offic not good and not good the way they took the money in 2015 the unit nation depart top climat offici reportedli describ the 100 billion dollar per year as peanut and state that the 100 billion dollar is the tail that wag the dog in 2015 the green climat fund execut director reportedli state that estim fund need would increas to four hundr and fifti billion dollar per year after 2020 and nobodi even know where the money is go nobodi been abl to say where is it go of cours the world top pollut have no affirm oblig under the green fund which we termin america is 20 trillion dollar in debt cashstrap citi cannot hire enough polic offic or fix vital infrastructur million of our citizen are out of work and yet under the pari accord billion of dollar that ought to be invest right here in america will be sent to the veri countri that have taken our factori and our job away from us so think of that there are seriou legal and constitut issu as well foreign leader in europ asian and across the world should not have more to say with respect to the us economi than our own citizen and their elect repres thu our withdraw from the agreement repres a reassert of america sovereignti our constitut is uniqu among all nation of the world and it is my highest oblig and greatest honor to protect it and i will stay in the agreement could also pose seriou obstacl for the unit state as we begin the process of unlock the restrict on america abund energi reserv which we have start veri strongli it would onc have been unthink that an intern agreement could prevent the unit state from conduct it own domest econom affair but thi is the new realiti we face if we do not leav the agreement or if we do not negoti a far better deal the risk grow as histor these agreement onli tend to becom more and more ambiti over time in other word the pari framework is just a start point as bad as it is not an endpoint and exit the agreement protect the unit state from futur intrus on the unit state sovereignti and massiv futur legal liabil believ me we have massiv legal liabil if we stay in as presid i have one oblig and

former us attorney assist us attorney an associ attorney gener under ronald reagan i might add i would have indict her by the way by the way everi singl person in thi room clinic would have die tempest to what she did how about how about we have the same system of justic for the clinton as they have for all of the rest of us here what donald trump want to do for the economi he want to bring job back our recoveri under barack obama ha been pathet the onli thing barack obama ha done wors than handl our economi it the way he handl our foreign polici where he made us where he made us kind of a joke you know draw those line in the sand and a facad to use chemic weapon he wa go to do someth then he drew the first red line and assad did it and then the second one and the third one final the line the line start to turn a littl orang by the time it wa finish the line were yellow becaus he threaten and did noth about it that is what you describ as a weakl and he been a weakl on our economi three quarter in a row growth of less than 2 it pathet for a countri with the power of thi countri with a strength of thi countri with worker with worker like you now here how you chang it first thing you do is you lower tax immedi lower them you take the corpor tax down from thirti five percent to fifteen percent do you know whi court if you were run a compani and you can go to ireland and pay twelv percent tax and you had to pay thirtyf percent actual forti or fortyf percent tax when you consid state local tax in america wouldnt wouldnt you be tempt to go to ireland well that what happen to us were chase our busi out of america we are tax them out of america we have the highest corpor tax rate in the world the wonder we are not abl to produc good job sustain job it isnt it isnt becaus were not give peopl enough welfar we sure do that boy and weve doubl mayb even tripl the number of food stamp under obama obama answer hillari answer is make you depend on the govern our answer is to put out our hand help you get a job and make you depend on you that what america about we are not a socialist countri and we will never be a socialist countri we are not a european we are not a european social democraci look how well theyr do where america a land of opportun a land where peopl work hard so we are also go to do away with the death tax so peopl who have farm dont lose their farm the death tax is so unfair all your life you pay tax to the govern now it up to 38 39 40 percent and see a state like mine it over fifti percent in tax the govern is the senior partner in my wayjourney im the junior partner they own more of me than i own to myself so what we want to do is chang that we want to put money back into your hand so you can spend it we want to do away with obamacar immedi so that so that your neighbor can go back and rehir those four worker and mayb four more worker and we can cut us health insur in half so we can afford it we want to renegoti the trade agreement that are unfair to us and have taken job right out of thi state of north carolina and send them to mexico and other part of the world we sign trade agreement we sign a trade agreement with korea it wa suppos to give us a great big surplu we end up now with the largest trade deficit with south korea that we have ever had in our histori donald trump will be abl to renegoti those treati and by do that he will produc job the infus of money into the economi the renegoti of the trade agreement will creat job now let me tell you where that plan come from donald trump didnt invent it i didnt invent it that wa the plan john kennedi had that wa the plan ronald reagan had and we had two of our period of greatest growth when we cut tax in the earli 60 in the earli 80 i will tell you from my own person experi that is exactli what i did in new york citi i cut tax and i went from a 25 billion dollar deficit to a 35 billion dollar surplu and i did it and i did it not by give welfar to peopl but by give them job that whi you need donald trump he is the onli one who can challeng thi system there someth there someth realli wonder if you look at american histori it alway seem like we have the right person at the right time almost alway right and were not even sure where they come from or how we find them you know how we found abraham lincoln at exactli the right time with georg washington or how we found how we found ronald reagan an actor all the stuff theyr say about trump they said wors thing about ronald reagan i rememb i rememb i rememb a movi think it wa on abc about how ronald reagan wa go to destroy the world becaus of hi polici toward the soviet union if you have that work out well he liber million of peopl that how it work out the berlin wall fell down and abc never apolog they never apolog for be wrong ronald reagan follow the same program reduc tax cut the size of govern as donald trump will tell you in a few minut cut down the regul that are crush us put our coal worker back to work put our steel worker back to work i am a big believ in a safe environ i am not a big believ in ridicul excess idiot interpret of environment law that depriv of of million of job and depriv us of power and to privaci the abil to build our busi china is burn coal india is burn coal you think they do it safer than we do so what good is it do with all these regul that obama is put on that are put coal miner out of work and hillari clinton ha told them they are go to be out of work now what hillari clinton program hillari clinton hillari clinton is go to rais tax she even said the other day the onli truth thing she said in 20 year she said im go to rais tax on the middl class now she said have you ever heard of a freudian slip of cours she ha to rais tax on

includ the one she now adopt from the socialist berni sander right you cant get that money just from the millionair it cant you have to you have to you have to tax the middl class in order to get that

go to do it base on talent base on all of the thing that we need for the differ posit we have such talent in thi countri and were not use it were just not use it such incred talent and speak of talent so what with thi voter id in north carolina right what with thi you know i keep talk about rig the system i watch berni sander work work work poor old berni he work work work and i said i think the system rig you know the superdeleg what happen to berni where is he what happen but were gonna get a lot of berni voter i think we realli will becaus i talk about trade and ive been talk about it for year mani year befor i wa do thi hey ive been do thi for like what 15 month now befor long befor i wa do thi i wa talk about trade and what a disgust situat it is for our countri do you know that two day ago i met a support and he in the tile busi great guy but he said hi busi is be decim by foreign countri where they make tile and the towel not nearli as good and he cant send hi tile to those countri becaus there a twentyseven percent tax and it veri tough but they can send their stuff in here and their stuff by the way is not as good as what thi man make and you know the trade thing it all like we talk about free trade and i want trade and im not an isolationist by the way i want free trade but i want to be great trade for our countri it got to be a twoway street it got to be a too wast and it will be a twoway street again it will be a twoway street but he wa tell me how imposs it wa for him in thi case it wa china but it realli almost everybodi how imposs it wa for him to do busi in china and not for long and well do busi in china were go to do busi in china but were go to do it on an equal foot right now they can dump their product and you know what im talk about thi steel they dump and i think they dump it to put our steel compani out of busi so that we have to go to china to buy thi stuff and you know what not go to happen anymor folk it not go to happen anymor and if you think hillari clinton know anyth about it number one i know about it but even if she did it wouldnt matter becaus she control by her donor and her special interest total control by her donor and special interest so if she knew it wouldnt make ani differ wouldnt make ani differ whatsoev so were go to bring back our trade you know somebodi said to me what the most import well there so mani thing we got to repeal obamacar replac it we got to have strong border at me there just so mani thing you can go on and on and on we could stand here for three day we could tell you what wrong and so mani of these thing are so easi to fix one of the thing that amaz me when i talk about trade i want to have trade i think it good the concept of trip it got to be fair but here the thing i say im go to renegoti nafta which is a disast front by the way in north carolina and virtual everi other place in all fair but they have rip busi from your gut theyv taken busi out of thi state out of ohio out of michigan michigan ha just been decim by nafta the auto plan youv got to see what theyr build in mexico they are build some of the greatest biggest most modern plant in the world for car for comput for everyth and you know what folk i think that fine but were not go to help them were go to fight for ourselv were go to have our polici veri simpl america first rememb that american for so we have essenti two peopl run and hillari made it through a small field i made it through a larg field and she got through i got through were stuck with each other just fine and ill tell you what if you knew where she stood or the second amend on the rais where she basic want to take your safeti away she want to take your gun away and by the way if she appoint suprem court justic mean if she get the option to a point mean a veri sad day in thi countri becaus if she becam presid she would do a terribl job thi would be four more year of obama and we dont want four more year of obama we dont want isi we dont want regul we dont want high tax all of these thing would would be an extens thi would be an extens a fouryear extens of obama and i think in mani way it may be end up be wors so if she get to a point suprem court justic you know the next presid will appoint probabl three but it could even be four or five that the way the card for will be a record set number possibl and we had judg scalia as an exampl that wa suppos to be justic scalia wa suppos to be there for a lot longer and that he wa taken from us and he wa a great guy and we are go to appoint justic you know i name 11 peopl that are highli highli vet highli vet heritag and differ peopl and gone through differ peopl that i respect conserv peopl smart peopl and veri importantli and the real standard if we could find as close to justic scalia becaus he wa a terrif unit state for a chang now if on the other hand if hillari appoint if hillari appoint justic of the suprem court you can have a lot of problem folk you can have a lot of problem becaus you know if theyr on the court for 20 or 25 year and you have four of them let say or three of them or five of them i mean were gone for like what 75 year mean were gone as a countri becaus we will be a larg scale version of venezuela that what go to happen and you see what happen in venezuela so we cant let it happen we cant let it happen now just a coupl of thing and i wrote these down a week ago and ive said it and i mean it but i said unstabl hillari clinton lack the judgment rememb when berni sander talk about judgment he said she ha bad judgment now when he said it nobodi pick it up and when i say it nobodi pick it up either becaus you cant say bad becaus the press will never pick up anyth that correct or accur or bad about it now it such a it is such a doubl standard but berni sander said that hillari clinton had bad judgment and he said it mani time and he said it over and over and then i think he wa realli ask not to say that anymor and he stop becaus they were perhap more civil that we were on our side we would never stop but hi bad judgment her tempera a word she use all the time is terribl it a loser tempera she got the tempera of a loser i have the tempera of a winner and we have to win again the winner she said about me not so long ago my tone she said i dont like the tone he one i dont like the tone of donald trump now in the middl east theyr chop off head theyr drown peopl in steel cage theyr buri peopl in the sand and she doesnt like my tone i think it time mayb for a littl tougher tone folk you know no time for exampl so the bad judgment alon you cant pick a hit look whether you look at libya you look at syria you take a look at the migrat take a look at thi she want to put and i said five hundr percent and the press said i wa wrong it wa in the right number five hundr percent more peopl come in from syria we dont know who they are where they come from she want and i said five hundr percent more than presid obama and he got a pour in right and the press said i wa wrong you know what the real number wa five hundr and fifti percent i couldnt believ it i wa on the low side i wa on the low side five hundr and fifti percent more than we have come in right now and you know what thi is go to be in my opinion and ive been pretti right of these thing i said dont go into iraq wa right about it i said and by the way onc we were in iraq get out the way obama got out caus problem that are go to be veri hard to solv i said i repar what they have done what they have done in term of get out of iraq isi come about you know i said befor also in north carolina i said that if they gave a trophi for the most valuabl player you call it in sport most valuabl player award the winner of the trophi for isi would probabl have to be hillari clinton right hillari club and now she go to tell you how to get rid of isi she go to tell you how cuz her and obama and i guarante you that if obama had the choic to do again now he ha to go and play the game but if he had the choic to do again for secretari of state and if he knew what took place in the middl east and other place i guarante you he would never have pick hillari clinton he would never pick her he would not have gone that way now your not go to hear that im sure he tell that to hi wife but that about it becaus he cant but that the way it is shoshi she is just a person that if she presid were gonna have problem like youv never had befor she talk about tough with russia wouldnt it be nice if we actual got along with paper would not be a nice thing okay you know russia is a nuclear nation ha nuclear weapon in her she tough they talk about crimea i answer a question perfectli they were talk about russia and what i would do with ukrain and russia but you know by the time thi is now take place crimea is alreadi a part of russia essenti right and thi happen on obama watch so they put out a thing about me i didnt know foreign polici i didnt know foreign polici whi did you let crimea go to russia they dont want to mention thi they dont want to mention the fact that when i wa ask about nato that i said look nato obsolet now im not an expert on they know but i have a lot of common sens id have great busi sens i made a lot of money and i had great success but but you know what built a great great compani far greater than anybodi even understand but but you know what i said nato up celin and they all smile and laugh oh donald trump he said it obsolet dont forget thi wa done for the soviet union mani mani mani year ago now let say russia tough so it okay for russia to write what save fine but thi wa done origin for the soviet union at worf to russia that fine but we have a new threat it call terror and then not equip for terror they dont even have the right countri for terror and i said thi actual to wolf blitzer cnn but i said thi and peopl smile oh that funni isnt that funni three day later they start say trump is right it realli obsolet you know you ever hear the express you cant see the forest for the tree right right you cant see the forest for the tree you guy good peopl they studi nato theyr so close theyr so close that they cant see what go on so all of a sudden three four day later somebodi came out think you know trump got a point and then a coupl of month ago on the wall street journal on the front page i read becaus i said terror it absolut becaus it not cover terror the way it should be and then all of a sudden they read a big stori front page sir in the wall street journal nato to develop terror divis and i wa onli mention like one eighth of one sens that i essenti wasnt happi they could have given me a littl more credit but that okay today the credit i want our countri to be great

somebodi that know what he or she is do and i do know what im do when it come to busi i know what im do it been an amaz period of time for me it been great fact my two son of backstag mayb im allow to bring them up becaus im veri proud of my boy so mayb ill break them mayb ill bring them on and good that beauti thi is don thi is eric and they were with me for the last week and they go around make speech of thi way ill send them they do a better job than me anyway so i go into the room and i watch televis you know and they say the trump are make speech say hello don well thank you veri much it great to be here it nice to be avail to be proxi for him becaus we know what he feel about thi countri we know the valu that he instil in us grow up educ famili work ethic all of these thing that are often lost on children of similar fortun he dont read about mani children that came from the kind of wealth that we were abl to brought up with in the way that you perhap read about us and i wont talk about myself that way but ill talk about my brother and sister that way so those are all thing that he doesnt get credit for those are the thing that you dont see those are the thing you dont see when he a father when he now a grandfath to my five children it realli incred that he like to talk about busi and he phenomen at that but if you knew the real donald youd also see someth realli special he an incred guy and were just thank that he do thi for not onli ourselv our children behind them but for everyon in thi countri becaus hell do a phenomen job you know to reiter to reiter would you know don realli said he ha been our best friend he been our mentor he just absolut greatest weve work cross tabl with him for the last 10 year build hotel and golf cours and everyth all over the world and you know everyth he touch turn to gold i say the whole time but everyth he touch turn to gold and you know that the touch that thi countri need it realli is and there will be no better

to death and well give it back to you thank you thank you thank you sweet so a lot of time peopl ask me to speak about success friend of mine and theyll even make big payment so we give it to chariti and stuff but ill do it and so often ill say you know the realli success peopl are the peopl not with the great wealth but with the great famili where they have great kid and wive and husband and those are the peopl that are the happiest and i dont know if im speak against myself here but the fact is that you know you can have i know the most success peopl in the world i deal with them all the time i know them i know i know im in mani case veri well these are not the happiest peopl gener a coupl of happi not too mani becaus you know no matter how success they all want more more more it never satisfi and i guess i get a littl bit guilti of that also but the fact is that the happiest peopl i know the peopl with great famili have love their famili and when their famili love them so it someth i talk about dure a success seminar and a lot of time the peopl run the seminar dont want to hear that that not exactli what they want to hear but i have to be truth so and there a good exampl i have two realli great boy i have five children all togeth and theyr all been theyv been fantast you know ivanka most of you know evancho who go to have a babi in about a week weve been wait we thought iowa we thought new hampshir right we thought south carolina we thought vega would be an interest mice ever been a much differ deal but she probabl like it dure the next week or two show up a babi and she been spectacular than i have tiffani and i have baron and theyr all theyr all veri good kid so hope theyll stay that way wiz would i think i should not go and went off to fight sublett wait is anybodi superstit oh that real word to that not that that that the real deal so anyway now theyr good kid and it realli great what we have to do and i think the reason were reson is we have to straighten out our trade deal are horribl with china we lose in trade five hundr billion dollar a year what kind of a deal is that with japan we lose hundr of billion of dollar it much smaller than china but hundr we owe japan one point six trillion dollar will china 17 trillion dollar sort of an amaz thing right they take our money and then we owe them money they take our job we are their money they take our factori you have no idea how mani are close up and have close up and i have great relationship with china have great relationship with japan i have great relationship with mexico but mexico is kill us at the border and theyr kill us in trade you know you read the other day where carrier move into mexico did anybodi read that stori i thought it wa veri sad carri the mackerrick condit and theyr move in and they releas 1400 peopl and i guess somebodi had a cell phone go which im sure carrier wa not thrill with becaus it went all over the world and the execut wa stand up say were close up and were go to move to all those job are gone and were go to move to mexico and i said to myself well how doe that help us how doe it help us so theyr go to make air condit theyr go to sell them across the border probabl have illeg welcom in becaus it cheaper that way you know nobodi nobodi check them well nobodi check them so you know just everi everi illeg get an air condition walk across port doe the same thing you know theyr probabl when they you know for it build a two and a half billion dollar plant and theyll have illeg drive the car across the block so it veri sad honestli it veri sad it so it so bad that sometim you have to laugh you cant even believ it so for it is is a build a massiv plant nabisco is move from chicago into mexico im in mexico is liter the new china theyr take our busi it go to becom the car capit of the world they took a plant out of tennesse who go to it wa schedul to be built in tennesse and boom tennesse such a great place they took it last moment it decid it go to mexico so we have to do someth we have to have border we have to have strong border if we dont have border we dont have a countri and peopl can come into our countri but they have to come in legal they cant do what theyr do we have right now 179000 illeg immigr who are crimin who have crimin convict that mean all 170 i think of that so that like fill up yanke stadium four time we have all over the countri these are are crimin thi is not just you know these are peopl that were convict of a crime so were go to be veri strong on the border were go to be veri veri strong on trade were go to be veri strong and protect our second amend were go to get rid of common core which is basic educ through washington which is a disast by the way and you understand that and were go to get rid of obamacar obamacar is turn out to be a total disast and and it it realli hurt our countri it realli hurt our countri becaus you have so mani parttim job right now becaus peopl dont want to regist under obamacar and you have part everyon ha parttim job i mean you look at these peopl they never had a parttim job in their life and now all of a sudden compani are put them on parttim and now they have to go get a second job so it a veri unfair thing and were go to get rid of it were go to come up with a plan there so mani differ plan whether it the health care save account or or we have to get rid of the line between the state that onli there for one reason becaus all of these politician that im run against and more are take care of by the insur compani and theyr take care of by the oil and ga compani and theyr take care of by everybodi im the onli one that not you know whi im not becaus im selffund i dont know if that smart or not so smart but but but as a big contributor ive been over the year a veri big contributor i understand i mean i understand what it take we have a situat right now with drug we dont bid out drug can you believ that the unit state is the largest drug buyer in the world drug to make you better pharmaceut and we dont bid it out and a friend of mine who a doctor great guy came up to me and said donald whi dont we i dont understand it well onc i found out what he wa talk about becaus it not my world i know exactli whi becaus the pharmaceut industri take care of all the senat and all the congressmen they have a veri strong lobbi and they dont want to bid on drug if you bid amount will save 300 billion dollar three hundr million dollar and we dont even do it were go to do it becaus what happen if im there theyll be call donald you cant do that you cant do it trust me i can do it they cant do it becaus theyv been given million of dollar you dont know how corrupt it is and i guess it call legal corrupt but you dont know how corrupt it is and whether it timber industri anyth ill do the right thing by the way im go to be great for industri too but ill do the right thing but we have to straighten our countri at one of the other thing bigger than that is militari i mean for year weve been see the militari and we see ive been read about it for year where they order a plane that they dont want are the order missil that they dont want they want a differ one becaus the compani make that missil ha more polit influenc so theyr order thing that even the gener dont want and theyr order too much equip and theyr order the wrong equip those day are over and were go to make our militari bigger better stronger than ever befor we need it more than it a cheapest thing we can do by the way and nobodi go to mess with us i dont want to use it nobodi go to mess with us rememb im the one i didnt want to go into iraq i said it wa one of the worst decis ever met we lost two trillion dollar thousand and thousand of live thousand of live we have wound word who i love all over the place and what happen iran is now take over a wreck when you think of how iran is do late right between the aranda we give 150 billion dollar we got noth for it we should have gotten our prison back long befor we start negoti and all you do is say listen were not negoti until we get our prison back we cant and theyll say no and you leav the room they didnt leav the room they never let they just stood there carri thi is the worst negoti i think ive ever seen he never left the room and but all you have to do is say we need our prison back thi is like four year ago when they start thi longest negoti ive ever seen two but you say we have to have our prison back theyr go to say no the persian i mean pat can tell you that the person are great negoti and theyr smart and it tough but you go and you say we need our prison back you dont want them you dont need them your peopl dont even know theyr there we need them and we got to have them and well make a better deal becaus it easier so then theyll say no and well leav the room will say byeby and then we doubl up the sanction and within 24 hour are go to call and say you get your prison back rent then you go in for second becaus you have to do thi so you go in and you say listen and i tell the stori which is sort of cute my father wa a veri good negoti and he thought i wa too rough he thought he said too tough your too tough he kind of just take the lump said he use to use the express hed alway go like thi when he said it a son take the lump out so if i didnt have my father i would have said thi were not give you the hundr and fifti billion dollar so did be over there and theyd be angri and you know you probabl never bring it back but id say it veri tough were not give it to you but now i learn so much from my father so i take the lump out so now say listen we have a problem now in the meantim our prison back they land id say did they land yet no i wont say it yet let wait till the next i did they land ye they just land on american soil so now i say fella we have a problem a big problem we have a countri not do well we owe 19 trillion dollar essenti were buse got no money got no money we just had a budget approv for two trillion dollar with 21 trillion we have no money fella we cant give you the 150 billion theyr gonna go crazi theyr gonna go first one day one day and as im sorri i want to give it to you so badli you have no idea im die to give it you but i cant we dont have ani money so that better than say were not give it to you right do we all agre it the same effect except thi way they recov faster they probabl both work i know the second one work the first one you know you could end up in a posit where it go to be a long time befor you said no way i would have given them 150 billion dollar no way in a million year and one of the saddest thing is the money gone and by the way two day befor the money left see the order that you hold that book up see the art of the deal here is in everybodi who didnt read the other than everybodi wa young but i alway say the bibl is much better there not a contest right that one of the great book but the bibl is much better i so so there are so mani not even close do we agre i will tell you right were good but the art of the dealer ha been a great book obvious kerri did not read the art of the deal probabl didnt read the bibl either but these are but it a veri sad thing that whole that whole episod with iran is a versão thing and then two day befor the money is sent they captur 10 beauti young sailor they put gun to their head they rough them up in term of at least mental they were devast and they humili our countri they humili the ten peopl one woman and nine men and that the work that what were deal with not go to happen anymor folk not go to happen anymor were go to do were go to be the smart countri instead of the dummi that everyon left sat they laugh at us becaus we have peopl that dont know what theyr do like sergeant bergdahl we get bergdahl a traitor they get five killer that theyv covet theyv want for nine year and those five killer are back on the battlefield or soon will be but these are the one they want these five so we knew he wa a traitor befor we made the deal becaus at a gener and a colonel interview all of the peopl that he work with in the militari they knew he left six peopl die look for five definit probabl six die they went out look for him they tri to get him back he left and we get that the way we negoti we get bergdahl they get five great killer for them the peopl that they want not go to happen anymor not go to happen so i tell these stori that i go around and i meet with crowd that we have tremend grad we have by far the biggest grad far far far bigger than berni and berni head down now i think berni look like he over and look like hilari is go to be protect from the email scandal by the democrat i mean can you believ it so mani peopl for do much less than she did are in prison and and just you know devast dont think of it think of it for do less than she did and she look like she just gonna be you know she gonna run boy did you ever see anybodi so nice to the presid though oh the presid is wonder she say oh the presid he great what he want to do thi all that wonder whatev you want you know whi she do that right do you know whi i know whi boy oh boy she becom like a marshmallow she becom she everyth he doe oh it wonder whatev he want to do is wonder the presid man i take couldnt be her life cannot be so easi but she she is what she done is so wrong and it so unfair and it look like shell be the nomine and it look like noth will happen but itll be someth that will be discuss i promis you it will be discuss off and off and often so with that i think were realli do well it look like were in a great trend and we have tremend support and we have amaz peopl in thi countri and one of the most amaz peopl in the whole countri is our great friend pat will you come out here pat look at him what are the great peopl thank you man it good to have you here with us give you inspir us all it great to be here good good morn to be here supposedli got lost i probabl would have call that fat i dont know if i want to be there today right now we had a great we had a great even great even but let me ask you work on them a project in washington on pennsylvania avenu the old post offic build everybodi want it but you got it they arent of the deal what did you do well it a great build it the old post offic built in the 1880 it got it an amaz build with wall that are five and six feet thick of solid ground and you know they dont build them that way in here today they use like plastic right and thi is an amaz go what are the most beauti build in washington and for year it wa the post offic and you alway say i alway say to peopl if you can get the post offic in the citi you alway get the best locat becaus theyr alway there first right and thi is the one for washington so they put it out to bid and everi wa one of the most hotli contest project ever in the histori of the gsa govern servic with a sort of the landlord for unit state real estat big len hood and they chose us and it a great honor becaus we were chosen in the obama administr which is sort of amaz becaus a lot of peopl thought we wouldnt be abl to get it but we had a we have a great financi statement they want to make sure it get done and we have a great track record for the stuff and were build now a hotel 300 room that is go to be i think one of the great hotel of the world where a year and a half ahead of schedul even more than that but were year and a half ahead of schedul which is a littl unusu when your talk about govern becaus they never he wa close but were one and a half year and were under budget and it will open in septemb of thi year and theyr suppos to open up in septemb in two year from now and i thought i could do someth you know we realli have a great team eric and donna work on it and a vodka is realli in charg of that one and she done an amaz job and it go to be one of the most beauti tell i think itll be one of the great hotel of the world um less assum that he you run the tabl and that you about a year from now that you got your hand on the bibl and your swear an oath befor the chief justic the unit state and then your presid at that point here is okay there a littl offic underneath the capit where you could go to and by the stroke of the pen you could cancel a great mani of the execut order of your predecessor you dont need congress you the execut order you know you what would you do well i would do that and we expect to cancel mani of the execut order that were pass becaus you know obama ha not been abl to run thing the way your suppos to run im suppos to get two congressmen in the senat in your suppos to make deal like ronald reagan tip oneil they were opposit but they made deal and they like each other i will say thi that ive been involv in polit for a long time well my life ive gotten tremend zone chang i deal in polit and other countri becaus were build all over the world and we have job go up all over the world a lot of job but i have never seen divis like you have now you know it use to be you go to a restaur in washington you see a republican have dinner with a democrat and theyr best friend sure you dont see that in thi hatr the countri is so divid whether it african american white congressman democrat republican i mean it just like we have a whole divid countri id never seen anyth like it but we use to see and i use to be part of democrat and republican have dinner togeth with their famili on their live and it wa a nice thing and then you know theyd be combat the next day but there would be to get along and they get thing done so today we have a presid that cant get anyth done and he sign execut order so one of the first one that knockout is hi execut order on the second amend where he chip away at it which is so import the second amend and the other one would be the one on the border where basic he want peopl to pour into the countri uncheck and the court have been you know follow that one and amazingli we had a coupl of pretti good decis so far but it still out there so id save the legal fee frankli id get rid of it id knock it out veri fast but becaus we do have to and i know you believ in thi you have to have strong border if we dont have strong border you saw the pope came out against me a littl bit but that wa befor he wa veri nice becaus the next day he issu a statement he realiz he had a pretti big wall around the vatican and say we say i mean he wa told probabl that oh you have thi man name trumpet he want to creat veri strong border that he want to build a wall we gotta build a wall were gonna build a well drug are pour across the border peopl are come in just like it like we dont even we dont even have a countri you know im a border you dont have a countri so but he wa he wa good he he wa a littl bit strong at first sort of interest he goe is a day befor the elect right and i said to myself oh no and my peopl came up to me they said mr trump the pope just made a big statement about you i said good or bad now you have to say we have the elect like the next morn so it good a bad they said not good i said oh thi is a disast and it turn out to be that he you know he talk about the border and he did mention the wall and then i said the first thing i thought if i said but ive seen the vatican that the most incred wall that wall goe up to that ceil right i said what about thi so i think he actual took a littl ii wa veri veri nice the next day you know nobodi explain to him about the crime nobodi explain to him about the drug pour across and the economi and he wa actual veri nice but it wa a veri interest you dont want to hear the day befor the elect that the pope said someth about you thi time weve got a massiv deficit and were run a deficit everi year and the wast spend is out of control and there wa a commiss senat simpson and erskin bowl got togeth and gave a veri reason propos have you adopt anyth like that weve got to have some way of cut the spend now well i have the other then and and i think i could add to it a lot though becaus im go to bring job back to the countri man our countri ha been strip weve rebuilt china and again i like china i think china is wonder im not angri to china im angri at our repres are peopl are presid for do such bad deal and not just obama thi goe back you know thi isnt just now but obama ha been horribl and other have been also and so im not upset with china i have them as tenant in my bag had the biggest bank in the world is a tenant and one of my build in manhattan i million and million of dollar worth of condominium to the chines so i cant be angri at that same thing with mexico i mean i have great relationship with mexico problem is in both case but realli in all case all countri everi countri is kill us becaus we have peopl that are polit hack that are negoti trade deal they know noth about it and they have the smartest sharpest peopl that they pick out when theyr practic three year old you understand that they go up thi pyramid chain and they pick them out veri earli and our peopl cannot deal with it becaus were not use a right and we have the greatest busi peopl in the world we dont use them so carl icahn as an exampl endors me of mani of the busi peopl endors me the great one and were gonna use my greatest busi peopl to negoti trade deal and what not be lose thi kind of money we have horribl horribl deal with japan and everyon els you know there wa a law pass someth oxley and the number of ipo that have been brought forward sinc then have been drastic curtail now we got the invers where peopl go from ireland to canada there are some littl tax and put their headquart there true and yet our tax burden on corpor is probabl the highest in the world what are you gonna do with it so we have the highest tax in the world the unit state think of it with deficit like thi and yet we have high tax im cut tax veri substanti for busi were go to bring busi back were go to bring our job back were go to make sure that you know look china is one of the great money when their currenc manipul in histori ever ever there nobodi ever like thi japan is realli good but china is even better and they have done a number on us with with manipul with devalu in fact our dollar goe up and everyon say oh isnt that wonder in the meantim look at caterpillar they can sell the tractor it it a veri bad situat go on so and they have no fear of us they have no respect for us anymor in the south china sea just befor i left i wa watch where theyr build is massiv massiv militari complex in the middl of the south china sea then that suppos to be do it but theyr do it becaus they dont respect our presid they dont i mean he give them state dinner when they come over here is no they have no respect and we have a lot of power over china we just dont know it we have peopl that dont know it the power is straight weve rebuilt them they are take so much money out of our countri what theyv done and i say it the greatest robberi in the histori of the world what theyv done weve rebuilt china you just take a look we have rebuilt when theyv taken so much money and we have to stop it and we have to use our power becaus we have a lot of power becaus of trade we have to stop it and we can get them to do thing like they have to solv the north korea problem we have a door career problem that you probabl know better than i do is i know that also part of the world that you look at your own but we have a big problem you know they dont exist without china but china pat us well we dont have that kind of control theyr just toy with us if total control over him the other one that doe is iran so whi didnt we when we made our deal a month ago whi didnt we insist that they take care of thi guy instead of us go over alway go over with the ship and the weapon and the plane and you know drop bomb if we have to and then you have south korea with who i love i build in south korean but they make a fortun i by televis set i buy tremend amount of thing from there becaus we dont make televis set ani more folk i would like to make i mean we dont make of it we use to make them you rememb sylvania rca but those day a gun right were not even suppos to be talk about that becaus it show that were not as young as we use to be but but we dont make it anymor and here you have an econom behemoth in south korea and they pay us peanut but everi time we have twenti eight thousand soldier between north and south korea who that a danger job by the way but we have 28000 soldier we get paid peanut they make a lot of money and the good peopl everyth good but they have to take care of us were not in a posit to be the policeman of the world we have to be taken care of and so there are a lot of thing we can do when were presid but what do we onli didnt know that how would you specif go after the north i mean they claim theyv got a thermonuclear weapon oh yeah you think well i would start with china all right becaus china ha absolut power the stuff come through china id also i would have done iran but i dont think your gonna get anywher with a random becaus theyr a hostil nation they took our money theyr spent the money they bought a hundr and eighteen airbu plane instead of boe okay in other word the money goe to europ they bought a lot of thing in itali they bought a lot of thing all over europ and they bought missil which i didnt know they had the right to buy they bought a lot of missil from russia they gave us noth we gave 150 billion ad 150 billion theyv spent a lot of it noth goe to the unit state i would have been veri strong in the negoti that iran ha to push them and i would have been i would now be veri strong on china becaus again we have a lot of power over china becaus china take out so much money so we lose again i said befor five hundr billion dollar trade deficit with china cant do that but how long you have a countri if you do that so i hate to tell you folk you need somebodi like me im good at thi time that the politician dont even know about it they dont even know they dont even know what it mean they realli dont they talk about free trade im a free trader but you gotta have smart trade to you have to intellig yeah yeah and i say therel be a text like kerri i wa just say kerri is move over to mexico theyr gonna make air condit your go to sell them to us no text no noth so we lose 1400 job they move to mexico they build a plan to employ mexican peopl which is fine they make aircondit say so i would tell them here the stori folk here thi and thi is the onli thing you can do to stop it ive been in all fair here the stori your go to make your condit we wish you a lot of luck i hope you build a nice plan to enjoy yourselv but everi time you put an air condition into thi countri you send to their condit your gonna have a thirtyf percent tax theyr not go to move then im move becaus you have to do it that cool yeah got pat there are peopl who would say oh your not a conserv well im the most conserv guy in mani way but you have to be smart you otherwis everyon go to move were not gonna have anybodi left you know you know the kind of thousand and thousand of factori have close in our countri and pat said it befor corpor invers you have peopl they cant get money back in that they have yeah and theyr actual move compani not onli becaus the tax are too high but theyr move compani out of the unit state like pfizer not sure if eye is a great compani to move our thousand of judgment theyr move to get money becaus there 25 trillion dollar outsid of the unit state they cant get it in and yet the democrat and the republican agre bring it in so all you have to do if your obama is sit down with both within 10 minut youd make it if there a case where everyon agre on they can i can tell you the stori but i mean i like that exampl becaus so there two and a half trillion i think it could be five trillion could be more than that but you know the govern send two and a half but they dont know they have no idea if they say two and a half it probabl much more but here a case where democrat and republican are in total agreement you know it one thing they disagre on health care that disagre at all these other thing and we get all right and stuff but here someth thing they all agre on we want the money back in our countri you know what not to agre on right so you can work on a littl tax a littl disel to let but it should be it should be 10 minut to solv that problem so they agre here they agre here the money is go to come back in no deal theyv agre now for three year and what that is it leadership if i were presid i would get them all in an offic big offic and i would say fella weve got to make thi deal folk becaus we have a lot of women now and that good we have to make thi deal we have to make thi deal let get it done i think youd have it done in a half hour but you need leadership you know you cant fli to hawaii to play golf on a boe 747 talk about the talk about the carpet you know patti talk about the carbon footprint right and then he get into 747 to play golf and he spew the stuff and come back a long time later it wasnt like he came back the next day he come back play a lot of he play a lot of go well cellular but but you got to get peopl into an offic and you got to make deal one last question i know david got some game in the audienc with scalia just that he wa a dear friend here at region a dear friend of all of us and a great justic the court wa in a conserv mode 52 for a lot of vote in here and now weve got a the nice presid may have ginsburg but you know there may be three judg threesom look for theori would you use to well we have some good one we have judg alito who a terrif sam ye terrif we have judg thoma oh i think is a terrif judg get a real strong veri veri good guy and we have some that didnt work out as well i mean if you look at justic robert he could have kill obamacar twice no matter what he doe it like you know he wa appoint by bush by the way i will tell you that senat cruz is the one that push him he wa the one that most want him fact he wrote editori too but you got to have robert you gotta have robert and just as robert wa a terribl terribl situat becaus he approv obamacar when everybodi said it wa go to be termin he wa the vote that said were go to keep it wa then he had a second time at it which would have also kill it and he pass it then too and some of the other judg are the conserv i mean the rumor are that some of them wouldnt even speak to him but what he did wa terribl now he wa a bush appointe and he wa realli propos he the one that push him harder than anybodi wa cruz senat cruz and so senat cruz gave us obamacar in the true sens becaus ani good could how in fact that you have you have right now they have editori where he wrote he wrote actual paper when whi he should be the one chosen sign by ted cruz so i mean he ha been no matter what he doe he been a disast say becaus obamacar is kill everybodi it kill everybodi so one more question in your select as presid what criteria would you use to pick some of the prolif well we want we want start to the day start a veri conserv veri veri smart i mean like judg scalia would be a perfect you know that he wa like a perfect he wa a perfect repres i ive alway said that justic thoma doe he get enough credit he a wonder woman he is he a wonder man is a wonder guy and as i said judg alito is a terrif guy so in that realm is what were talk about for me but weve got some question all right theyv come in from all around and i would turn thi over to our friend david thank you sir hello mr track you david courtesi ah here a question from the simulcast room becaus thi event is huge you know and you know weve got an overflow room by the right i thought youd like to know that ill see a lot of peopl up there as theyr everywher all right here the question it about israel it from keri from the simulcast room support of israel essenti for continu stabil in the middl east obvious and for maintain a firm stanc against terror will you and fatica least and with israel ye a question veri simpl answer ye theyv been our most reliabl alli especi in the middl east and youd look at you know what happen with israel they were so against thi horribl iran deal they were so against it and i tell you what obama wa the worst thing that ever happen to israel you could look at it as he not a good presid and he not do a good job and you look at bibi netanyahu you look at what he ha gone through i mean you could just see the level of exasper on that man face how they just the most basic thing they werent win anyth whi did we make a deal like thi with these peopl and they look at us like they have no respect for us whatsoev they cant believ themselv that they were abl to get thi deal i dont get it i mean i dont get there are a lot of theori out there but i dont get it thi will be studi and studi for a long time and thi will prove to be a veri bad deal thi will lead to nuclear prolifer one hundr percent and all the money we gave everyth we gave even the keep of their hostag and you know ultim the releas hostag 450 billion dollar they releas so it realli look like ransom the other way it wouldnt have been ransom the way i said it would have been back four year earlier no im with israel one hundr percent all right next question thi also from the simulcast room jame want to know about the constitut as presid what will you do to restor adher to the constitut by all level of govern well im a veri strong constitutionalist i mean i feel so strongli about it and weve gotten away i mean frankli i think you could say it not give it a lot of thought but all these execut order that not a constitut thing and nobodi ever saw we have a presid who just goe and doe say you know who spend three minut tri to talk somebodi into it youll see he got a littl burden and he just goe in sign an execut order and he say hey five year later the court will decid so it not the way it suppos to be the good thing about execut order is the new presid can come in and immedi annoy them that that the one good thing all right thi is an interest one right from here in the studio audienc from bernard dure thi campaign there had been a great deal of tough lot of tough languag among the candid can you forgiv and forget to put it asid to join togeth and also pick a vp choic made from one of these folk that might have been say a few thing i can forgiv i mean im pretti good at that i i do have everi onc in a while theyll be somebodi that went too far and i wont like it i mean youv been hear what ive been say over the last few week and you know thing were said that were lie frankli they were realiz and i wont mention becaus i cant my shin pad presenc i want ive got to be a good person today at least for the next hour im sorri but there have been mani there have been mani untruth told and it wa just know know i mean i think what happen to ben carson wa terribl when they said he left the race he left the race here come on over vote for me that affect me too cuz i think i would have won iowa you want to know the truth yeah what were do okay weve got a second and three first so im not complain but i like for first i 14 but but you know what happen to ben carson what happen there wa horribl the notic violat the you know they call it a motor violet that like a fraudul document that wa said so there have been some bad thing happen out there you know i tell peopl real estat is pretti tough in real estat in manhattan you meet some tough peopl these politician are not such good peopl all right lexi from the audienc right here mr trump there are some who say that in the past you have support democrat liber view how can voter be sure that you will truli hold and would actual continu to uphold republican idea and valu well you know it interest as a one of the magazin that donald trump is a worldclass businessman and it wa sort of interest im all over the world and i deal with all politician and honestli i never thought id be do thi i just got exasper i would have done it for year ago i look at it veri serious with romney i wa actual lead in the poll and i decid you had a lot of job go my children are younger and now they can do a great job and ive excel execut but but it thi is not someth i realli wa go to do it we realli want to do i love what i wa do the fact is that as a businessman you get along with full politician for you have a problem so i get along with democrat i got along with liber and conserv and republican i get along with everybodi becaus that wa my thing you know it wa veri import i got along with bob where bob my cell bob in the audienc where is he where what by the way and and a fantast person okay you know that i fan stand up there is a fantast person and but i get along with everybodi i get along with them and that wa import and i tell peopl and peopl would forgiv me for that theyd say well you know it true but as a businessman you want to get along with democrat republican everyon and i think for the most part you know that been use on me and i understand it but onc i explain it most peopl understand all right ken from right here in the audienc want to know assum you will be the nomine of the parti what are the most import qualiti you are go to look for in a vice presidenti candid and feel free to name some name that wa my part that wa my partner actual there are some name that ive gotten to respect that or you know that have been on we start over 17 were now down to five and you know some of the peopl that have dealt with i do have a lot of respect for their like look the main qualiti that you want is somebodi that can be a great presid if someth happen to you that got to be dont you think that got to be number one pleas and then i would want somebodi that could help me with govern so most like that would be a polit person becaus you know im busi and im veri good at what i do and all of that and im also veri veri polit ive youv seen me you know when you can get zone on the west side of manhattan to build almost 6000 unit of hous and you have to go through new york citi polit believ me your that as tough i dont say israel palestin but it about as tough a deal it about as tough for the other i view that as the singl toughest deal anybodi can make that deal and were go to give it a shot okay were go to give it a shot but a lot of good peopl have gone down tri to give that one a shot but the most import thing is you have to have somebodi that could be a great presid but after that you want somebodi that can help you with legisl get it through etc etc so i would say without ani stori im not think about it a lot im think about get the bowl over the line and you know get thi thing done and it a veri interest thing becaus some peopl know how to do that some peopl dont but i need i what i do want somebodi that polit becaus i want to get lot of great legisl that we all want past it just sit there for year and year and year we have thing sit that it would be so good includ proper health care and other thing so were go to probabl choos somebodi that somewhat polit kid all right well pleas make lemon stuff that i thought dank he had a busi day and you win them out and come to virginia i mean it a big deal hillari if you were presid would you instruct the attorney gener to indict her for what she done in relat to the email well it an amaz question becaus you know there a sixyear statut of limit might be five but probabl six and the answer is i would have i would instruct them to take a look at it you know cuz it not realli our call to say indict yeah but certainli you would have to take a look at it becaus you look at gener petraeu he suffer greatli they gave him two year suspend and lot of thing they want to take hi rank away from him i fought that veri hard i said thi man suffer enough whi dont you focu on beat isi instead of leav gener petraeu the law just didnt malon i think i think it help them but they want to cut hi rank way down and a lot of other thing they want to do too but you know he suffer greatli over thi and what he did is noth compar to what she did so i would instruct my attorney gener pleas look at it and if there someth there there seem to be a lot there becaus you know everi day we see peopl that we read about peopl that are expert in the field and there how often you see somebodi say she did noth wrong theyr all say she did someth veri wrong but theyr protect her becaus she the number one runner and she say how wonder obama did you ever see anyth like it everi singl thing that he want to do she say great so she do it for that reason believ me folk well doubl i want to thank you i think the audienc realli appreci and love you i would ask

and you know importantli the new york post fred dicker great writer for the new york post polit writer he said that trump veri well could win new york new york ha never been in play for a republican candid it just not in play they dont even think of it they dont even campaign there i will be campaign in new york i love new york okay and i will be campaign in new york and if we win new york it over you understand becaus we pick up so mani deleg were also do realli well in michigan so you know the republ from a structur standpoint republican have a hard time becaus structur after win pennsylvania after win ohio you have to you know they have like a map of in particular six state and you lose one it over democrat ride is a much easier ride but if i pick up new york or if i pick up michigan it over folk it over so were go to do great with hispan peopl are go to be surpris we just one in nevada and we won with the hispan and we won that fortysix percent so peopl are go to be surpris were go to do phenomen with the african american theyr go to be phenomen were go to have were go to have larg number were go to have larg number of peopl come over you know they use to call them they use to comb the reagan democrat now well still keep let keep go them the reagan democrat theyr come over there go to be with us were gonna have a lot of peopl a lot of independ come over so and i think you know one but somebodi said if it trump against hillari clinton it go to be can you believ she honestli honestli she should not be allow to run now berni sander is over you know he took a big beat but you look at south carolina so they just left south carolina she had a good victori over him i drew and the republican do so much more so mani more vote like doubl it and they went down becaus there no enthusiasm valeri none we went way up becaus whether peopl like me or not there is enthusiasm that i can tell you there is enthusiasm big big big enthusiasm so it been go along well it been a nasti nasti deal you know what i said id run for offic i deal with real estat peopl i deal with peopl i deal with peopl much tougher much much tougher than the peopl im deal with but theyr more honest in a certain way politician are veri dishonest peopl ive never seen such decept ive never seen so mani lie and these are dishonest peopl and i hate to say it and it said it said and i say all talk no action i mean i build a great busi of phenomen busi i file my paper with the feder elect commiss everybodi ha it these peopl back there have it they go through everybodi impress a lot of peopl said number one they said hed never run then i ran then they said hell never sign what they call for may form a is where you liter sign your life away i sign for me then they said oh hell never put in hi financi becaus mayb he not as rich is peopl think so i put in my financi which show that a much richer the compani is phenomen is phenomen the compani is like incred and frankli the presid have that much to say they were there you have no idea the first day they said theyd never seen at the feder that theyd never seen peopl look that mani peopl tri to look at paper so the paper are great low debt phenomen asset some of the great asset big cash flow and i put them in and the reason i tell you that is becaus that the kind of think we need in thi countri that what we need we have we have 19 trillion dollar in debt go to 21 trillion that the kind of think we have to make great deal but anyway i put in my paper peopl came the press went through everi inch of him they said wow thi is amaz we didnt expect thi becaus the compani is actual much bigger much stronger and great and then i have to listen to a littl guy like rubio say oh he a con man he a con man now thank you now but it all it so insult and he had no choic i guess he had to come up with someth cuz he get cream in the poll he like 20 point down in florida you know in florida where he come from thi guy couldnt be elect dog catcher right now fear and now think of it he defraud the peopl of florida he too front him he defraud him in a lot of way you know mayb he defraud the republican parti build driveway with their money you know they catch him he build a driveway and other thing and they say your not suppos to do that oh im allow to they say well we caught you he said oh i use the wrong credit card ill pay you back he pay back noth happen you know chri christi would take it a littl bit differ than that and by the way speak of chri i wa stand on the dai a few week ago and i watch i call him lightweight i watch lightweight marco rubio danni right here and i watch thi and i saw a meltdown i said what am i watch you know we have million of peopl watch and i saw an almost complet meltdown in fact i wa prepar to catch him when he fell i wa i realli thought he wa go to fall they ask him a question he gave the barack obama answer right and he gave a sir and then he gave the same answer again cuz he like your machin he like a robot you wind him up but he talk it like a robot we call him the robot well we call him the lightweight but we call him the lightweight robot but he gave the answer first time gave it a second time gave it a third time gave it a fourth time and then at the fifth time i said to someth wrong and then i look he wa soak wet like he just got out of a swim pool with hi cloth on and it wa it wa honestli ill be honest it wa a sad thing to see but you cant have thi kind of a person negoti with the chines negoti with putin can you imagin he go to go and see putin putin a confid guy smart guy he sit down and marco walk in and marco walk in and he soak wet he exhaust he soak wet putin go to look at and say what the hell wrong with that guy do you rememb when he wa answer the republican brilliantli pick him to give the answer to obama in the state of whatev i guess one of the speech what are the by the way a veri import speech so obama got up did hi thing and now we have our respons right and he speak and you see there someth wrong with him and he speak and then he goe total off camera dure live televis and he grab a bottl of water with the label on it now unless he had a piec of that compani i think it wa a terribl thing to do he had a piec of the compani we could all understand that right and he start chug water nobodi ha ever seen anyth like that befor so we cannot have choke artist run organ our choke on it we cannot have choke artist run our countri our countri is in troubl our countri is in troubl now ted cruz on the other hand he ted cruz smarter no he a smarter person than rubio but but he so strike i mean folk it not gonna work okay it not go to work you know he think it good we call him lyin lyin ted hell tell ill tell you know hell listen to me say someth hell get up someplac els and he will say the exact opposit of what i said for instanc im veri strong in the second amend he say donald trump is total oppos to the second member the p that have been with me know for year i mean you know what ive been say i am and i happen from the begin against obamacar were go to repeal it and were go to replac ted cruz goe on televis and he goe donald trump love obamacar i love obama im everi singl speech i say repeal and refin i think if anybodi been a lot of peopl come to thi becaus we have a lot of fun but everi singl speech i talk about repeal replac and hell just like so i call him lie and it wa interest becaus littl marco said the other day he said your a liar to take you as her refer to me said your a liar that a lie it the first time ive ever heard a politician and i deal with a lot of politician and believ me they are liar in mani case and there some good one but not too mani but marco said to ted your a liar and i said you know now that a politician say it you have to politician theyr say if theyr scream at each other then they got togeth and they said all we have to be tough to last debat did you see him shake hand behind my back shake hand theyr highfiv each other insid befor the thing i said i said you know what they dealt with theyr doubleteam and yet everi singl paul drudg everi singl poll ha trump win the debat a pretti amaz right pretti of it and and most peopl other than you know some peopl some of the pundit are total you know forget it i could ill tell you that were go to write a book about some of the pundit i think the problem is who go to buy a book like that becaus nobodi care about them the press is amazingli dishonest okay the press is a real problem in thi countri and one of the thing that veri import to me and it onli no no i tell you what im deal with some real sleaz bag up here believ me i think the press is wors okay im tell you theyr wors than the politician and not all not all but eighti percent and one of the thing i mean i get stori that have no basi in fact whatsoev and one of the thing they can write anyth they want you cant soon becaus the libel law are they essenti dont exist and one of the thing im go to do is im go to open up the libel law were not go to do anyth with freedom of the press freedom of the press is vital it import it a cleans system it total someth that we cant touch but when peopl write incorrectli about you and you could prove that they wrote incorrectli were go to get them through the court system to chang and were go to get them to pay damag and you know what go to happen when you do that with a press your go to see a much more honest press and your go to see a press frankli that your go to respect a lot more and youll read i mean your go to read peopl dont believ the press anymor and i dont either and the polit press is the worst of the worst of all so and i dont say oliv but id say eighti percent okay that pretti good number id say thi fifti percent fifti percent of them are absolut sleev okay absolut twentyf percent are okay dont care if they do their job you have twentyf percent that pretti good you have ten percent that outstand all right you have temper said they realli are their outstand i met some outstand peopl in the press but a big chunk of it is realli realli dishonest so i just want to let you know and to be honest the way they write about me you know tronic they did a stori reason in one of the paper and they talk actual it someth that work out a coupl of thing you know a great deal maker when you can take a deal and make it good when it shouldnt be good the market crash in the middl your build a build to market crash not your fault and you come out and make a lot of money becaus you know your way around you do that and ive done number a number of those deal but they call up they want to know about thi steal thi steal that deal i said let me ask you a question what about the 250 great deal you want to know about them know were not interest in them it is so it is so incred what you go through with the press and it veri unfair and the amaz thing is peopl understand that peopl know and that whi they have such low number when you pull the press i mean theyll rank i think below congress and congress is almost not even rank so it an amaz thing youv got to keep your eye open youv got to keep your ear open and we want honesti so were go to get the law chang so that the press ha to be honest and if theyr not honest if they say thing that are wrong they can be su and they can have to correct and mayb pay penalti and mayb pay someth do you like that idea to me i think it realli good so we have a situat that on januari or so of thi year i went out and i said you know what we are make progress like ive never seen befor but januari from the previou year i wa realli mix do i do thi do i not do it i gave up a lot i gave up a lot of deal and a good deal that i do just automat i gave up the apprentic i mean im not do the apprentic they came to me the head of comcast great guy steve burk came up to my offic said donald would love you to renew would love you to renew i said steve i cant do it becaus im go to run for presid i think he said your not go to run your not go to run you your gonna do it your not go to write it i realli think im go to run but you can never be sure becaus let me tell you to do thi take gut to run for prayer im not a politician to run for presid take gut and i didnt know correct correct correct you said it veri well thi guy said it veri well but im not allow to say that so yeah how about vincent a fox he use the f bomb right can you imagin if i use that word and thi came he wa the presid of mexico and while were on it becaus i want to just say i watch that display i watch the hatr and the anger in hi face and it wasnt just about the wall becaus were gonna have strong border and we will be build the wall with build the world the build the world were build the wall a hundr percent were build the wall okay we need the wall we need the world you know what peopl are go to come into our countri but theyr go to come in legal legal theyr go to come your go to go through a process and theyr gonna come in were gonna have great peopl come into our countri but they come in legal so anyway i watch thi guy and i saw it on televis and he said and then he said he wa talk about pay becaus who gonna pay for the wall who mexico gonna pay so these politician come up what do you mean donald mexico not pay for the world they dont have a clue they are so bad theyll tell you what if for some reason god said it not go to be you it go to be one of these peopl you might as well give up never go to happen folk they dont even know what im talk about the other day ted said on televis were go to build a wall first time i said where did that come from my wife came to me said ted cruz just said were go to build a wall when did it come from then rubio the other day littl marco he said were go to build the wall were go to build a wall oh these peopl theyr never go to take you to the promis land folk it not go to happen theyr never bring you to the promis land but they come up to me at the begin and they said your not seriou about a wall it cant be built i said realli china 2000 year ago built a 13000 mile wall right thinkin the great wall of china still stand veri strong veri big veri power china built that wall 2000 year ago it 13000 we need 2000 mile but realli 1000 becaus we have a lot of natur barrier that we dont have to build so we need 1000 mile china ha 13000 mile but im go to make my wall even higher than china wall were go to make it big were go to make it so beauti it go to be the most beauti wall becaus you know what go to happen theyr go to say let name it the trump wall and i want it to be realli good look okay but much more importantli it go to be a wall that work it go to work and it doe work and if you want to ask you just ask israel wall work if your do right we built these wall theyr like a joke they build ramp go over the wall they load up their truck with drug they go over the wall i dont even know whi they dont just knock it down you ever see the pictur of the ramp where they build ramp go over the wall itll be cheaper to just knock down the wall thi is the kind of stuff we do so here what happen so vincent a fox who wa the past presid wa so angri and he say there no way mexico got paid for the you know what wall right and he wa the anchor and i realiz that anger wasnt about the wall that anger wa about how dare somebodi question mexico becaus they get their way how dare they ? oh how dare they come and say we have to do thi or we have to do that folk with the unit state whether the night of sex and ill tell you what we are not take thi stuff anymor from all these countri that are rip us and laugh at us we have stupid leadership we have incompet leadership and when i take it anymor and i watch that guy and he wa so angri that somebodi would suggest that mexico is go to pay for the wall but he wa so angri that there wa actual like somebodi would be talk back to mexico i have a great relationship with mexico i have a great relationship with mexico peopl and with hispan in fact i employ ten of thousand of peopl ten of thousand of peopl are you back there darl who protest anybodi oh get out of here get him out get him out get him out get him out so he just got a televis eas happi just got on televis hey hey folk listen do you rememb when berni sander wa up make a speech and the two young girl came up and took the microphon away rememb that that not happen here folk that never go to happen rememb that he walk by i were run against him i just keep run that commerci he walk by like a littl boy i tell you it wa disgust when i saw that i said thi is go to be a leader it wa it but he over now anyway im no fair nobodi show up and berni sander is over he had a good run and by the way in all fair by far i have the largest crowd by far but he had the second largest crowd i will say but i think youll see hi crowd now realli start to dwindl cuz it over unless he get indict in which case he back in the driver seat right but i think she be veri protect i think she be veri protect by the democrat even though mani live were ruin for do a lot less for do a lot less than she did so it veri unfair but it will be brought up i promis you folk it will be brought up on a minut to minut basi okay we will not forget so i watch the hatr and the anger of thi past presid of mexico the actual anger and i realiz it wa more than the wall it wa that they would actual be told so we lose fifti eight billion dollar in trade deficit a year with mexico fifti eight billion dollar the wall is go to cost ten billion dollar when these charact come up mexico will never pay for the world when your lose when you have essenti theyr make fifti eight billion dollar were go to get 10 of that billion so quick in fact i think now that i watch him im go to ask for much more money becaus were go to make that wall bigger better stronger i actual got a call from one of the report that stand right back there look at all that press is not amaz look at that oh to school i met your dean i met your head person a love woman i said thi school is go to becom so famou off is thi girl famili thi school those peopl there from all over the world but you know what one of them call me after the guy did the fbomb nobodi ever talk about that they dont talk about that not one person talk about that all they talk about is he against the wall he not go to pay for the way so they said how do you respond to hi anger and how do you respond to the fact that he say they wont pay i said you heard it the wall just got 10 feet higher okay 10 feet high believ me were not go to be the dopey peopl anymor were not go to be the stupid peopl anymor were go to be the brilliant peopl were go to be the smart peopl were go to be the peopl that bring in money were go to be the peopl that creat job for our countri not for china and not for mexico you know the biggest question i get you have a lot of young peopl it is a great colleg by the way i want to tell you it a great guy it great school one of the one of the question i get especi when i go to you know school and colleg is the debt is just kill peopl the debt the govern debt they borrow from the govern the cost of the colleg are go through the roof and the biggest problem we have you know what it is you graduat your a good student you have a great school like thi and sometim it hard to get job and im be nice when i say sometim becaus i know you peopl hey is everybodi all set with job rais your hand who got job okay who doesnt oh no that a lot of hand that a lot of hand that a lot of talent so here what happen peopl go to a great school they graduat you know top of their class they graduat with good bark they work realli hard their parent are proud everybodi breath they cant get a job let get a chang folk your gonna get job your go to get such great job were go to bring job back from china were go to bring them back from mexico we will start befor im finish i guarante you that we will have appl product made in the unit state not in china okay i guarante it and plenti of other compani you know we had a case the other day i wa veri vocal about it becaus i think it disgust and im a conserv person but i call myself commonsens conserv you have these peopl that i dont know if they know anyth about busi or it but they believ in free trade and i do too but free trade ha to be fair trade right dont you agre it got to be fair it cant be free for them and everyth get all the benefit so if you take your countri like china china say all that stuff at here no tax come on in dump whatev the hell you want it doesnt make ani differ perfect i have friend or in manufactur busi if they want to sell to china number one they cant and number two if they do they have to pay a massiv tax beyond they call it a tariff by the way cuz it sound a littl better but it not free trade okay so youll have some of these conserv peopl like a nation review some of these magazin that dont have a clue theyr all go out of busi anyway so that a good thing but they dont have a clue they dont understand busi and theyll say trump is not a true conserv becaus he want to charg attack to a countri well theyr tax us okay so theyr tax us i want to charg the same tax okay and it not even industri you know what go to happen it not even go to realli start a trade war but of cours if you think about it with china thi year we will lose five hundr and five billion dollar think of it and weve been lose similar amount for a hundr billion three hundr billion for year so they say oh youll start a trade war you know what when your lose that kind of money who the hell care who care who care now i deal with the chines and the chines are veri smart the great negoti are veri tough they work like youv never seen ive made a fortun deal with johnni on a big chunk of the bank of america build i own a 1290 avenu of the america one of the biggest offic build the biggest floor plate in new york citi ive had tremend success ive sold hundr of million of dollar worth of apart in manhattan to the chines theyr great i dont object

      "good afternoon good afternoon thank you veri much thank you veri much great to be here in virginia thank you all for be here it an extraordinari troubl time for our countri and the reason it so troubl is that we have a nation that today feel more divid than at ani time in my lifetim and were divid in larg measur becaus our leader are not provid the type of clariti about what are the import prioriti that the peopl want our countri to be pursu the first and most import thing to me not onli as a governor but more importantli as a husband and a father is the safeti and the secur of my famili and i respect you feel the same way and that safeti and secur is not just about be safe and secur from threat outsid thi countri it about make sure that we are safe and secur from threat of violenc from within our countri as well we need a presid who onc again well put law and order at the top of the prioriti of the presid in thi countri our polic offic the men and women who stand each day to protect us need to understand that the presid of the unit state and hi administr will give them the benefit of the doubt not alway believ that what theyv done is somehow wrong we need to stand behind the men and women in blue in thi countri i spent seven year as a member of law enforc as the unit state attorney in new jersey and dure those year the presid i serv made it veri clear to us that our first job wa to protect the safeti and secur of the american peopl and that everi other prioriti while import fell in behind that we need onc again to have a presid who put the safeti and secur of our citizen first and doe not blink or hesit to take the strong action that need to be taken to make sure that those both at home and around the world know that lawless will not be toler from anyon no matter how power or lack of power that those peopl may have one order need to be the first prioriti onc again in our in our countri and in thi come elect there can be littl question about where law and order stand and where lawless stand the fact is that we have the spectacl last week of watch a director of the fbi twice in one week repeatedli say that the democrat nomine for presid lie to the american peopl that the democrat nomine for presid put her own polit conveni ahead of the safeti and the secur of the american peopl an fbi director who said that the repeat assur that mr clinton ha given us over the cours of the last year regard her email scandal in fact in everi materi way were fals that not a person who will stand for the rule of law that a person wholl stand for the rule of her and that not what we need in the white hous and everyon who involv in law enforc should be right concern if you have a presid who put the rule of law behind their own person interest i support donald trump and have for quit some time becaus i know that he will be the type of presid who will put the rule of law first who will make sure that the law is enforc aggress and appropri and it will put peopl in hi administr to understand that the rule in thi countri and the law of thi countri appli to everyon not just the least power full but also the most power they appli to everyon and so i am grate and happi that you are here today to lend your voic to that effort and to also listen listen to what these candid have to say listen to how donald trump will stand up not onli for those who serv today in law enforc but also for the men and women who have serv in our militari they deserv much better than what thi administr ha given them that will be make that will mean make tough decis that will mean break some china all throughout the govern it will mean stop it will mean stop thi pattern of accept less than the best for the peopl of thi countri we need someon who ha alway demand the best from everyon who ha work for him and with him and it will place the interest of the american peopl first and foremost that is the person who is go to be our republican nomine next week and it is the person who i firmli believ will serv thi countri best as the next presid unit state we need to make sure that we go out there and fight as hard as we can to make that happen there will be no could have been should have been on the day after the elect it go to be we did it we fought for it we stood up and we took our countri back to law and order onc again in the seven year i stood hi us attorney i made sure that justic wa both blind and fair and we need to make sure that that return to our countri it ha left it in thi administr and we need to restor it and that whi im so proud

they have experienc effort to manipul their find and tri to make it look much better than it is it bad at the same time isi is tri to infiltr refuge flow into europ and to the unit state iran the world largest state sponsor of terror is now flush with 150 billion dollar in cash releas by the unit state plu if you rememb from two week ago anoth 400 million in actual cash that wa obvious use for

east and put the nation of iran which chant death to america in a domin posit of region power and in fact aspir to be a domin world power it all began in 2009 with what ha becom known as presid obama global apolog tour we all rememb in a seri of speech presid obama describ america arrog dismiss deris and a coloni power he wa describ us he inform other countri that he would be speak up about america past error he pledg that we would no longer be a senior partner than sought to dictat our term he lectur cia offic of the need to acknowledg their mistak and describ guantanamo bay as a ralli cri for our enemi perhap no speech wa more misguid than presid obama speech to the muslim world deliv in cairo egypt 2009 i rememb it well in win the cold war presid ronald reagan repeatedli tout the superior of freedom communist and call the ussr the evil empir yet when presid obama deliv hi address in cairo no such moral courag could be found or would be found instead of condemn the oppress of women and gay in mani muslim nation and the systemat violat of human right or the financ of global terror presid obama tri to draw an equival between our human right record and rememb thi our human right and there the record are unbeliev and unmistak hi naiv word were follow by even more naiv action the failur to establish a new statu of forc agreement interact and the elect driven timet for withdraw surrend our game in that countri and led directli to the rise of isi without question the failur in iraq were compound by hillari clinton disast total disast in libya presid obama ha sinc said that he regret and realli regret libya and the mistak he made he consid it hi worst mistak accord to then secretari of defens robert gate the invas of libya wa nearli a split decis but hillari clinton forc advocaci for the intervent wa the decid factor that whi we went in with one episod of bad judgment after anoth hillari clinton polici launch isi onto the world stage yet as she threw the middl east into violent turmoil thing turn out realli to be not so hot for our world and our countri the middl east in particular that clinton made almost 60 million dollar in gross incom while she wa secretari of state it is unbeliev incid after incid prove again and again hillari clinton lack the judgment as said by berni sander stabil and tempera and the moral charact to lead our nation importantli she also lack the mental and physic stamina to take on isi and all of the mani adversari we face not onli in terror but in trade and everi other challeng we must confront to turn our great countri around it is now time for a new approach our current strategi of nation build and regim chang is a proven absolut failur we have creat the vacuum that allow terror to grow and thrive i wa an oppon of the iraq war from the begin a major differ between me and my oppon though i wa a privat citizen whose person opinion on such matter were realli not sought by nonetheless publicli express my privat doubt about the invas i wa against believ me three month befor the invas i said in an interview with neil cavuto to whom i offer my best wish for a speedi recoveri that quot perhap we shouldnt be do it yet and that the economi is a much bigger problem in august of 2004 veri earli right after the conflict i made a detail statement to esquir magazin and an interview here is the quot in full look at the war in iraq and the mess were in i would never have handl it that way thi wa right after the invas doe anybodi realli believ that iraq is go to be a wonder democraci where peopl are go to run down to the vote box and gentli put in their ballot and the winner is happili go to go and step up and lead the countri come on i then continu two minut after we leav it go to be a revolut and the meanest toughest smartest most viciou guy in thi case guy will take over and hell have weapon of mass destruct which saddam hussein did not happen what wa the purpos of thi whole thing hundr and hundr of young peopl kill and what about the peopl come back with no arm and no leg not to mention it all fair the other side the tremend damag done all those araki kid whove been blown to piec and it turn out that all of the reason for the war were blatantli wrong all of thi death and destruct for noth so ive been clear for a long time that we should not have gone in but i have been just as clear in say what a catastroph mistak hillari clinton and presid obama made with the reckless way in which they pull out after we had made those hardfought sacrific and game we should have never made such a sudden withdraw on a timet advertis to our enemi they said were move out here our time here our day who would do thi but an incompet presid al qaeda in iraq had been decim and obama and clinton david new life and allow it to spread all across the world by that same token presid obama and hillari clinton should have never attempt to build a democraci in libya to push for immedi regim chang in syrian or to support the overthrow of mubarak in egypt one more point on thi i have long said that we should have kept the oil in iraq i set it over and over and over again anoth area what my judgment ha been proven correct i just said it so mani time virtual everi time i wa interview keep the oil keep the oil accord to cnn isi made as much as 500 million in oil sale in 2014 alon that befor they realli got start fuel and fund it rain of terror if we had control the oil like i said we should we could have prevent the rise of isi in iraq both by cut off a major sourc of fund and through the presenc of us forc necessari to safeguard the oil and vital infrastructur product necessari for us to have you know i wa say thi constantli and consist to whoever would listen i said keep the oil keep the oil keep the oil dont let somebodi els get it they had listen to me then we would have had the econom benefit of the oil which i want to use to help take care of the wound soldier and famili of those who die in the war in addit to which thousand of live would have been save thi propos by it veri natur would have left soldier in place of our essenc we would have had soldier there guard thi valuabl suppli of oil in the old day when we want to warn to the victor belong thi boy instead all we got from iraq and our adventur in the middl east wa death destruct and tremend financi loss but it time to put the mistak of the past behind us in chart a new cours and i becom presid the era of nation build will be brought to a veri swift and decis a new approach which must be share by both parti in america by our alli oversea and by our friend in the middl east must be to halt the spread of radic islam all action should be orient around the skull and ani countri which share thi goal will be our alli veri import some dont share hi goal we cannot alway choos our friend but we can never fail to recogn our enemi as presid i will call for intern confer focus on thi goal we will work sidebysid with our friend in the middl east includ our greatest alli israel we will partner with king abdullah of jordan and the presid of egypt presid sisi and all mother who recogn thi ideolog of death that must be extinguish we will also work veri close with nato on thi new mission i had previous said that nato wa obsolet becaus it fail to deal adequ with terror sinc my comment they have chang their polici and now have a new divis focus on terror threat veri good veri veri good i also believ that we could find common ground with russia in the fight against isi wouldnt that be a good thing they too have much at stake in the outcom in syria and have had their own battl with islam terror just as bad as our they have a big big problem in russia with isi my administr will aggress pursu joint and coalit militari oper to crush and destroy isi intern cooper to cut off their fund expand intellig share and cyber warfar to distrust and disabl their propaganda and recruit their recruit is take place right now and theyr set record it got to be stop we cannot allow the internet to be use as a recruit tool and for other purpos by our enemi we must shut down there access to thi form of commun and we must do it immedi immedi unlik hillari clinton who is risk so mani live with her careless handl of sensit inform my administr will not telegraph exactli militari plan and what they are and by the way what happen with her 33000 email is an absolut disgrac for the unit state ive often said that the great gener dougla macarthur and a great gener georg patton would be in a state of shock if they were aliv today to see the way presid obama and hillari clinton tri to recklessli announc their everi move befor it happen like they did in iraq so that the enemi can prepar and adapt their enemi si thank you the fight will not be limit to isi we will decim al qaeda and we will seek to starv punter for a ran back to mosqu and hezbollah so import we can use exist un secur council resolut to appli new and even stronger sanction militari cyber and financi warfar will all be necessari to dismantl islam terror but we must use ideolog warfar as well veri import and they use it on us better than we have ever even thought of use it on them but that will chang just as we won thank you just as we won the cold war part by expos the evil of commun and the virtu of free market so too must we take on the ideolog of radic islam while my oppon accept million of dollar in foundat donat from countri where be gay is an offens punish by prison or death my administr will speak out against the oppress of women gay and peopl of differ belief our administr would be a friend to all moder muslim reform in the middl east and will amplifi their voic thi includ speak out against a horribl practic of honor kill where women are murder by their rel for dress marri or act in a way that violat fundamentalist teach over 1000 pakistani girl are estim to be the victim of honor kill by their rel each year recent a promin pakistani social media star wa strangl to death by her brother on the charg of dishonour the famili in hi confess the brother took pride in the murder and said girl are born to stay home and follow tradit shockingli thi is a practic that ha reach our own shore on such case and mani mani case have happen but one involv an iraqi immigr who wa sentenc to 34 year in jail for run over hi own daughter claim she had been too western to defeat islam terror we must also speak out forc against a hate ideolog that provid the breed ground for violenc and terror to grow it a breed ground it a terribl terribl breed ground a new immigr polici is need immedi as well the common thread link the major islam terrorist attack that have recent occur on our soil 911 the fort hood shoot the boston bomb the san bernardino attack the orlando attack is that they have involv immigr or the children of immigr clearli new screen procedur are need a review by the us senat immigr subcommitte ha identifi 380 foreignborn individu charg with terror or terrorismrel offens between 911 and 2014 and mani more sinc then and thi year is a record for identif it gotten wors far wors we also know that isi recruit refuge after their entranc into the countri as we have seen with the somali refuge popul in minnesota beyond terror as we have also seen in franc foreign popul have brought their antisemit attitud with them in cologn germani on new year eve we have seen the report of sexual violenc and assault far greater than anybodi know pew poll show that in mani of the countri from which we draw a larg number of immigr extrem view about religion such as the death penalti and for those who are involv the death penalti is veri veri common if you dont have the faith that they demand you have a trumpet administr will establish a clear principl that will govern all decis pertain to immigr and we will be tough and we will conclud we should onli admit into thi countri those who share our valu and respect our peopl in the cold war we had an ideolog screen test the time is overdu to develop a new screen test for the threat we face today i call it extrem vet i call it extrem extrem vet our countri ha enough problem we dont need more and these are problem like weve never in addit to screen out all member of the sympath of terrorist group we must also screen out ani of hostil attitud toward our countri or it principl or who believ that sharia law should supplant american those who do not believ in our constitut or who support bigotri and hatr will not be admit for immigr into our countri onli those that we expect to flourish in our countri and to embrac a toler american societi should be issu visa to put these new procedur in place we will have to temporarili suspend immigr from some of the most danger and volatil region of the world that have a histori of export terror not for us not for us as soon as i take offic i will ask the state depart and the depart of homeland secur to identifi a list of region where adequ screen cannot take place there are mani such region we will stop process visa from those area until such time as it is deem safe to resum base on new circumst or new procedur the size of current immigr flow are simpli too larg to perform adequ scream we had been about 100000 perman immigr from the middl east everi year beyond that we admit hundr of thousand of temporari worker and visitor from the same region hundr of thousand if we dont control the number we cant perform adequ screen there no way it can take us by contrast my oppon want to increas which is unbeliev no matter who you are no matter where you come from want to increas the flow of syrian refuge by five hundr and fifti percent over what they are now the unit state senat subcommitte on immigr estim that hillari clinton plan would mean roughli six hundr and twenti thousand refuge from all current refuge send nation in her first term assum no cut to other refuge program so it could get wors thi would be addit to all other non refuge immigr unbeliev number unbeliev number the subcommitte estim a plan would impos a lifetim cost of roughli 400 billion dollar when you includ the cost of health care well fair hous school and all other entitl benefit that are exclud from the state depart placement figur think of thi 400 billion dollar insur hillari clinton want to be america angela merkel and you know what a disast thi massiv immigr ha been to germani and the peopl of germani crime ha risen to level that no one thought they would have biliti and strangl i mean we have enough problem in our countri we dont need more lastli we will need to restor common sens to our secur procedur anoth common featur of the past attack that are occur on our soil is that warn sign were total ignor the 911 hide you had fraud all over their visa applic almost everi one of them it said practic in big bold letter fraud and nobodi saw the russian warn us about the boston bomber here on polit zone and the attack were even twice interview by the fbi veri said the femal san bernardino shooter owner vient there are her statement and everyth that she said she wa here on a fianc visa which most peopl never even heard of from saudi arabia and she want to support veri openli jihad onlin those are the peopl were taken in a neighbor so suspici behavior bomb of the floor and other thing but didnt warn author becaus they said they didnt want to be accus of racial profil now mani are dead and mani more are grave wound the shooter in orlando reportedli celebr in hi classroom after 911 he too wa interview by the fbi hi father nativ of afghanistan support the oppress taliban regim and express antiamerican view veri strongli and by the way wa just seen sit behind hillari clinton with a big fat smile on hi face all the way through her space he obvious like what she had to say it call weak weak call stupid and we the fort hood shooter deliv a present to a room full of mental health expert befor the attack in which he threw out one red flag after anoth he even proclaim that we love death more than you love life not good these warn sign were ignor becaus polit correct ha replac common sens in our thank you that is whi one of my first access presid will be to establish a commiss on radic islam which will includ reformist voic in the muslim commun who will hope work with us we want to build bridg and eras divis the goal of the commiss will be to identifi the explain to the american public that core convict and belief of radic islam to identifi the warn sign of

togeth again our victori in the cold war reli on a bipartisan and intern consensu that is what we must have to defeat radic islam terrorist but just like we couldnt defeat commun without acknowledg that commun exist were explain it horribl evil we cant defeat radic islam terror but unless we do the exact same thing we have to explain varianc and explain a veri difficult day we have to have a

veri sad as to what go on throughout the world with terror our thought and our prayer are with all of those affect befor we discuss the pari accord id like to begin with an updat on our tremend absolut tremend econom progress sinc elect day on novemb 8th the economi is start to come back and veri veri rapidli weve ad three point three trillion dollar in stock market valu to our economi and more than a million privatesector job ive just return from a trip oversea where we conclud nearli 350 billion dollar of militari and econom develop for the unit state creat hundr of thousand of job it wa a veri veri success trip believ me thank you thank you in my meet at the g7 we have taken histor step to demand fair and reciproc trade that give american a level play field against other nation were also work veri hard for peac in the middl east and perhap even peac between the isra and the palestinian our attack on terror are greatli steppedup and you see that you see it all over from the previou administr includ get mani other countri to make major contribut to the fight against terror big big contribut are be made by countri that werent do so much in the form of contribut one by one we are keep the promis i made to american peopl dure my campaign for presid whether it cut jobkil regul appoint and confirm a tremend suprem court justic put in place tough new ethic rule achiev a record reduct in illeg immigr on our southern border were bring job plant and factori back into the unit state at number which no one until thi point thought even possibl and believ me weve just begun the fruit of our labor will be seen veri shortli even more so when these issu and so mani more were follow through on our commit and i dont want anyth to get in our way i am fight everi day for the great peopl of thi countri therefor in order to fulfil my solemn duti to protect america and it citizen the unit state will withdraw from the pari climat accord thank you thank you but begin negoti to reenter either the pari accord or in realli entir new transact when term that are fair to the unit state it busi it worker it peopl it taxpay so were get out but we will start to negoti and we will see if we can make a deal that fair and if we can that great and if we cant that fine as presid i can put no other consider befor the wellb of american citizen the pari climat accord is simpli the latest exampl of washington enter into an agreement that disadvantag the unit state to the exclus benefit of other countri leav american worker who i love and taxpay to absorb the cost in term of lost job lower wage shutter factori and vastli diminish econom product thu as of today the unit state will ceas all implement of the nonbind pari accord and the draconian financi and econom burden the agreement impos on our countri thi includ end the implement of the nation determin contribut and veri importantli the green climat fund which is cost the unit state a vast fortun complianc with the term of the pari accord and the owner energi restrict that is place on the unit state could cost america as much as 27 million lost job by 2025 accord to the nation econom research associ thi includ four hundr and forti thousand fewer manufactur job not what we need believ me thi is not what we need includ automobil job and the further decim of vital american industri on which countless commun reli they reli for so much and we would be give them so littl accord to the same studi by 2040 complianc with the commit put into place by the previou administr would cut product for the follow sector paper down 12 cement down 23 iron and steel down 38 coal and i happen to love the coal miner down 86 percent natur ga down 31 the cost of the economi at thi time would be close to three trillion dollar in lost gdp and six and a half million industri job while household would have 7000 less incom and in mani case much wors than that not onli doe thi deal subject our citizen to harsh econom restrict it fail to live up to our environment ideal as someon who care deepli about the environ which i do i cannot in good conscienc support a deal that punish the unit state which is what it doe the world leader in environment protect while impos no meaning oblig on the world lead pollut for exampl under the agreement china will be abl to increas these emiss by a stagger number of year 13 they can do whatev they want for 13 year not us india make it particip conting on receiv billion and billion and billion of dollar in foreign aid from develop countri there are mani other exampl but the bottom line is that the pari accord is veri unfair at the highest level to the unit state further while the current agreement effect block the develop of clean coal in america which it doe and the mine are start to open up have a big open in two week pennsylvania ohio west virginia in so mani place a big open of a brandnew mine it unheard of for mani mani year that hasnt happen they ask me if id go im go to tri china will be allow to build hundr of addit coal plant so we cant build the plant but they can accord to thi agreement india will be allow to doubl it coal product by 2020 think of it india can doubl their coal product were suppos to get rid of our even europ is allow to continu construct of coal plant in short the agreement doesnt elimin coal job it just transfer those out of america and the unit state and ship them to foreign countri thi agreement is less about the climat and more about other countri gain a financi advantag over the unit state the rest of the world applaud when we sign the pari agreement they went wild they were so happi for the simpl reason that it put our countri the unit state of america which we all love at a veri veri big econom disadvantag a cynic would say the obviou reason for econom competitor and they wish to see us remain in the agreement is so that we continu to suffer thi selfinflict major econom wound we would find it veri hard to compet with other countri from other part of the world we have among the most abund energi reserv on the planet suffici to lift million of america poorest worker out of poverti yet under thi agreement we are effect put these reserv under lock and key take away the great wealth of our nation it great wealth it phenomen well not so long ago we had no idea we had such wealth and leav million and million of famili trap in poverti and jobless the agreement is a massiv redistribut of unit state wealth to other countri at 1 growth renew sourc of energi can meet some of our domest demand but at 3 or 4 percent growth which i expect we need all form of avail american energi or our countri will be a grave risk of brownout and blackout our busi will come to a halt in mani case and the american famili will suffer the consequ in the form of lost job and a veri diminish qualiti of life even if the pari agreement were implement in full with total complianc from all nation it is estim it would onli produc a twotenth of one degre think of that thi much celsiu reduct in global temperatur by the year 2100 tini tini amount in fact 14 day of carbon emiss from china alon would wipe out the gain from america and thi is incred statist would total wipe out the gain from america expect reduct in the year 2030 after we have had to spend billion and billion of dollar lost job close factori and suffer much higher energi cost for our busi and for our home as the wall street journal wrote thi morn the realiti is that withdraw is in america econom interest and wont matter much to the climat the unit state under the trump administr will continu to be the cleanest and most environment friendli countri on earth will be the cleanest than have the cleanest air were go to have the cleanest water we will be environment friendli but were not go to put our busi out of work were not go to lose our job were go to grow im go to grow rapidli and i think you just read it just came out minut ago the small busi report small busi as if just now are boom hire peopl one of the best report theyv seen in mani year im will to immedi work with democrat leader to either negoti our way back into pari under the term that are fair to the unit state and it worker or to negoti a new deal that protect our countri and it taxpay so if the obstructionist want to get togeth with me let make them non obstructionist we will all sit down and we will get back into the deal and well make it good and we wont be close up our factori and we wont be lose our job and well sit down with the democrat and all of the peopl that repres either the pari accord or someth that we can do that much better than the pari accord and i think the peopl of our countri will be thrill and i think then the peopl of the world will be thrill but until we do that were out of the agreement i will work to ensur that america remain the world leader on environment issu but under a firm work that is fair and where the burden and respons are equal share among the mani nation all around the world no respons leader can put the worker and the peopl of their countri at thi debilit and tremend disadvantag the fact that the parasteel hamstr the unit state while empow some of the world top pollut countri should dispel ani doubt as to the real reason whi fahren lobbyist wish to keep our magnific countri tie up and bound down by thi agreement it to give their countri an econom edg over the unit state that not go to happen while im presid im sorri my job as presid is to do everyth within my power to give america

that have long sought to gain wealth at our countri expens they dont put america first i do and i alway will the same nation ask us to stay in the agreement are the countri that have collect cost america trillion of dollar through tough trade practic and in mani case lack contribut to our critic militari allianc you see what happen it pretti obviou to those that want to keep an open mind at what point doe america get demean at what point do they start laugh at us as a countri we want fair treatment for it citizen and we want fair treatment for our taxpay we dont want other leader and other countri laugh at us anymor and they wont be they wont be i wa elect to repres the citizen of pittsburgh not pari i promis i would exit or renegoti ani deal which fail to serv america interest mani trade deal will soon be under renegoti veri rare do we have a deal that work for thi countri but theyll soon be under renegoti the process ha begun from day one but now were down to busi beyond

boycott calli thi is one of those day where we could take a googl earth pictur of capitol hill and show all the place where news is break out so as paul ryan wa speak which he wa make news there in the committe behind me of cours that the jeff session hear where democrat are definit want to talk about thi and now we have new news relat to steve minuchin nomine for treasuri and tom price nomine for health and human servic the democrat on the relev committe that senat financ have come out and spoken to us and said they are boycot the markup hear which is where those nomin would be consid that is a veri seriou move that mean the nomin are stall and the reason they contend that in both case of steve minuchin and tom price that they have not been fulli truth with the committe which of cours is a requir of be a nomine appear befor these hear they take an oath so at thi stage they want to speak to these nomine again they want to speak to in dr price case it wa a member of congress the relev a compani where there are report that he got some preferenti treatment on a stock purchas they want to do more investig at the same time they are say if they can get those answer if there is an opportun to do more question than these nomin could conceiv go forward but also senat debbi stabenow of michigan also a democrat said that in other administr situat with less on the tabl as far as question about ani nomine have result in withdraw so rais the specter of could these find and the concern rais by democrat in some way lead to the withdraw or the demis of these nomin now weve talk a lot over these week about how republican have the advantag with number but were see polit pressur be brought against two of presid trump nomine in veri import posit health and human servic would be of cours in charg of revamp obamacar repeal replac howev republican stop to do that and of cours minuchin treasuri a huge job now to give you a sens of how they were describ thi here a senat sherrod brown of ohio were not go to thi committe today becaus we want the committe to regroup get the inform have these two nomine come back in front of the committe clair clarifi what they lie about i would hope theyd apolog for that and then give us the inform that we all need for our state and so use the word lie that is certainli ratchet thing up here on capitol hill and halli to give you an indic you must have a quorum to move forward so thi were into the sort of the languag of capitol hill right so we never that boycott that is enough to put the brake on these nomin until they can sort of work thi out halli quickli kelli befor i let you go back and do more report on thi you just put thi into perspect how unusu or unexpect is thi and is it realli just a polit stunt or do you see it have fallout in a concret way down the road there have been have cover other confirm period there have been time when nomine have withdrawn if they felt that there wa too much polit pressur now weve said in mani differ way how all thing trump are differ than the past histori weve seen with more tradit sort of nomine and more tradit administr these issu are the kind of thing that senat who have an advis and consent role take veri serious if they feel that nomin have not been fulli truth if they have not been forthcom if theyv answer question in error they want to get to the bottom of that now it will be incumb on these nomine to provid the answer there a burden on them to sort of clear thi up but democrat do have some power in thi and were see that exercis now so we may look back and see that thi wa a moment when thing turn or they may be abl to resolv it but the pressur ha been turn up by democrat today in a way within the rule that they can do that calli and kelli pressur also obvious on the confirm al for jeff session given all of the sort of drama we have seen around the attorney gener posit over the last 18 hour or so the hear for him it seem as though ali h is kind of a headlin thi morn ha that been your sens from be in and out of the room well thi is at a time when the night befor we didnt know what would be the hot topic at a given hear it been that kind of pace in the first dozen day of the trump administr veri much the case with the abrupt fire of salli yate who thi committe had person been involv with confirm those who had been on the committe in 2015 when she wa given the posit of deputi attorney gener now act attorney gener so that ha chang thing now we do expect that the session hear will be a bit more matteroffact in the sens that we are told to expect a partylin vote so more republican will support him a suffici number will support him and democrat will not back him that is not news theyv been foreshadow that in some issu statement say they would not oppos him but thi hear give a forum to talk about thi issu and these are the kind of issu that play right into the role of attorney gener and the willing of ani nomine for that posit to stand up to a presid to stand up for the constitut to take the kind of stand that she did and of cours there a disagr about what she did and whether that wa the appropri of cours but democrat say

vacuum becaus the way they got out of iraq wa unbeliev he stupid and ice is form now theyr in 32 countri she ha zero chanc of get rid of isi i have one hundr percent chanc okay i have 100 we have no choic is like were live in mediev time thi is it like it war and peopl get shot and peopl get kill and it horribl thi is peopl head are chop off by the hundr by the thousand and if you christian you have no chanc and it veri hard you know if your in syria ive heard thi for year it amaz even befor the migrat if your a christian it wa almost imposs to come into the unit state almost imposs and yet these peopl were under thi horribl horribl rule and they were be decim and kill and by the way the evangel christian jew cathol i have such tremend support it unbeliev some believ it unbeliev so were go to do thing that are go to make you veri proud or were go to be strong again a trump administr will also secur and defend the border of the unit state and as i said when these young attract peopl start scream they want the wall we will build a wall that will make you so happi to that group over there a lot of uthia were go to build a great wall and mexico go to pay for the wall and the reason were gonna have a great relationship with mexico the mexican presid short while ago veri nice with a great meet but mexico is beat us at the border theyr kill us entr we have a trade deficit with mexico that nobodi would believ it a fraction of what were talk about with respect to the cost of the world becaus a lot of politician ask me the question how are you go to get mexico to pay i said when you see their trade deficit billion and billion of dollar and you look at the cost of the wall then youll understand how easi it go to be so were go to build a wall itll be a great wall mexico gonna pay for the wall were go to stop those drug from pour in and poison are you were gonna stop it and it will be a great well mayb someday theyll name it after trump who the hell know i realli dont know if i want a wall but that we receiv the firstev endors from our ice and border patrol offic it just been report that as a result of our open border violent transnat cartel have spread into all 50 of our state youv read that more than nineti percent of those arrest are here illeg so nineti percent of the peopl that are here do the thing that you and i know theyr do are in our countri illeg theyr kill innoc american and other threaten school and total destroy commun a govern that will not protect it peopl is a govern unworthi to lead unworthi to leav i mean think of it think of it with respect to radic islam where you have a presid that wont mention the word and you have a candid that wont say radic islam terror how do you solv a problem if you refus to acknowledg it hillari will never protect your famili which is whi she can never lead thi countri but that onli one reason whi the other reason whi is that she is guilti of so mani crime and that whi it a rig system becaus she should not be allow to run and when you look at what go on with her protect youll understand exactli what im say when i say rig system you can ask berni sander about a rig system the mistak he made what he endors hillari clinton he made a deal with the devil and hi stock went way down and were go to get a lot of berni sander peopl support us becaus he wa right about one thing he wa right about the border and trade and you know what im much tougher on trade that he wa ever ever and a lot of hi peopl are come over should have never made a deal he would have gone down as a great person in polit histori had he not made that deal and now he just goe out and speak befor small crowd and then you see wikileak all the bad thing they say about him that alon should stop it that alon should stop it and just like i said that whi hillari should fire podesta how do you have peopl work that say these horribl thing about you where i love read those wikileak the immigr offic is warn in their letter when they endors me that hillari plan is the most radic immigr propos in the unit state histori it will lead to the loss of thousand and thousand of live and they know what theyr talk about folk as secretari of state hillari clinton allow mani mani mani peopl the most danger and violent crimin alien to go free becaus their home countri refus to take them back now i dont blame their home countri but well we catch drug lord killer gang member and we bring them back into their home countri i give you my word there wont be one instanc where that countri doesnt take those peopl and we are go to have a plan becaus they keep come back and back and back and back becaus were weak and were ineffect when they come back five year in jail when they come back again more than five year in jail and when they come back a third time much longer than that let me tell you folk that never come back it a veri simpl solut than never come back theyd come back 12 x 13 time they look at us they laugh hillari support total open border there goe your countri and strongli support sanctuari citi like san francisco where kate steinl wa murder by an illeg immigr deport at least five time here in ohio 60 year old margaret castl dick wa murder in cold blood by an illeg immigr last juli in nearbi concord township earlier that day her illeg immigr killer attempt to rape a fourteenyearold girl and shot

presid obama and secretari of state clinton let look back at the middl east at the veri begin of 2009 befor the obama clinton administr took over libya wa stabl syria wa under control egypt wa rule by a secular presid and an alli of the unit state iraq wa experienc a reduct in violenc but group that would becom what we now call isi wa close to be extinguish iran wa be choke off by econom sanction fast forward to today what we have and think of thi and the decis made by the obamaclinton group have been absolut disast libya and ruin our ambassador three other realli brave american are dead and isi ha gain a new base of oper syria is in the midst of a disastr civil war isi control larg portion of territori a refuge crisi now threaten europ and the unit state in egypt terrorist have gain a

30 countri they dont even know the situat is like wors than the public ha ani idea a new congression report reveal that the administr ha downplay the growth of isi with forti percent of analyst say they have experienc effort to manipul their find and tri to make it look much better than it is it bad at the same time isi is tri to infiltr refuge flow into europ and to the unit state iran the world largest state sponsor of terror is now flush with 150 billion dollar in cash releas by the unit state plu if you rememb from two week ago anoth 400 million in actual cash that wa obvious use for ransom worst of all the nuclear deal put iran the number one state sponsor of radic islam terror on a path to nuclear weapon ensur the obamaclinton foreign polici ha unleash isi destabil the middl east and put the nation of iran which chant death to america in a domin posit of region power and in fact aspir to be a domin world power it all began in 2009 with what ha becom known as presid obama global apolog tour we all rememb in a seri of speech presid obama describ america arrog dismiss deris and a coloni power he wa describ us he inform other countri that he would be speak up about america past error he pledg that we would no longer be a senior partner than sought to dictat our term he lectur cia offic of the need to acknowledg their mistak and describ guantanamo bay as a ralli cri for our enemi perhap no speech wa more misguid than presid obama speech to the muslim world deliv in cairo egypt 2009 i rememb it well in win the cold war presid ronald reagan repeatedli tout the superior of freedom communist and call the ussr the evil empir yet when presid obama deliv hi address in cairo no such moral courag could be found or would be found instead of condemn the oppress of women and gay in mani muslim nation and the systemat violat of human right or the financ of global terror presid obama tri to draw an equival between our human right record and rememb thi our human right and there the record are unbeliev and unmistak hi naiv word were follow by even more naiv action the failur to establish a new statu of forc agreement interact and the elect driven timet for withdraw surrend our game in that countri and led directli to the rise of isi without question the failur in iraq were compound by hillari clinton disast total disast in libya presid obama ha sinc said that he regret and realli regret libya and the mistak he made he consid it hi worst mistak accord to then secretari of defens robert gate the invas of libya wa nearli a split decis but hillari clinton forc advocaci for the intervent wa the decid factor that whi we went in with one episod of bad judgment after anoth hillari clinton polici launch isi onto the world stage yet as she threw the middl east into violent turmoil thing turn out realli to be not so hot for our world and our countri the middl east in particular that clinton made almost 60 million dollar in gross incom while she wa secretari of state it is unbeliev incid after incid prove again and again hillari clinton lack the judgment as said by berni sander stabil and tempera and the moral charact to lead our nation importantli she also lack the mental and physic stamina to take on isi and all of the mani adversari we face not onli in terror but in trade and everi other challeng we must confront to turn our great countri around it is now time for a new approach our current strategi of nation build and regim chang is a proven absolut failur we have creat the vacuum that allow terror to grow and thrive i wa an oppon of the iraq war from the begin a major differ between me and my oppon though i wa a privat citizen whose person opinion on such matter were realli not sought by nonetheless publicli express my privat doubt about the invas i wa against believ me three month befor the invas i said in an interview with neil cavuto to whom i offer my best wish for a speedi recoveri that quot perhap we shouldnt be do it yet and that the economi is a much bigger problem in august of 2004 veri earli right after the conflict i made a detail statement to esquir magazin and an interview here is the quot in full look at the war in iraq and the mess were in i would never have handl it that way thi wa right after the invas doe anybodi realli believ that iraq is go to be a wonder democraci where peopl are go to run down to the vote box and gentli put in their ballot and the winner is happili go to go and step up and lead the countri come on i then continu two minut after we leav it go to be a revolut and the meanest toughest smartest most viciou guy in thi case guy will take over and hell have weapon of mass destruct which saddam hussein did not happen what wa the purpos of thi whole thing hundr and hundr of young peopl kill and what about the peopl come back with no arm and no leg not to mention it all fair the other side the tremend damag done all those araki kid whove been blown to piec and it turn out that all of the reason for the war were blatantli wrong all of thi death and destruct for noth so ive been clear for a long time that we should not have gone in but i have been just as clear in say what a catastroph mistak hillari clinton and presid obama made with the reckless way in which they pull out after we had made those hardfought sacrific and game we should have never made such a sudden withdraw on a timet advertis to our enemi they said were move out here our time here our day who would do thi but an incompet presid al qaeda in iraq had been decim and obama and clinton david new life and allow it to spread all across the world by that same token presid obama and hillari clinton should have never attempt to build a democraci in libya to push for immedi regim chang in syrian or to support the overthrow of mubarak in egypt one more point on thi i have long said that we should have kept the oil in iraq i set it over and over and over again anoth area what my judgment ha been proven correct i just said it so mani time virtual everi time i wa interview keep the oil keep the oil accord to cnn isi made as much as 500 million in oil sale in 2014 alon that befor they realli got start fuel and fund it rain of terror if we had control the oil like i said we should we could have prevent the rise of isi in iraq both by cut off a major sourc of fund and through the presenc of us forc necessari to safeguard the oil and vital infrastructur product necessari for us to have you know i wa say thi constantli and consist to whoever would listen i said keep the oil keep the oil keep the oil dont let somebodi els get it they had listen to me then we would have had the econom benefit of the oil which i want to use to help take care of the wound soldier and famili of those who die in the war in addit to which thousand of live would have been save thi propos by it veri natur would have left soldier in place of our essenc we would have had soldier there guard thi valuabl suppli of oil in the old day when we want to warn to the victor belong thi boy instead all we got from iraq and our adventur in the middl east wa death destruct and tremend financi loss but it time to put the mistak of the past behind us in chart a new cours and i becom presid the era of nation build will be brought to a veri swift and decis a new approach which must be share by both parti in america by our alli oversea and by our friend in the middl east must be to halt the spread of radic islam all action should be orient around the skull and ani countri which share thi goal will be our alli veri import some dont share hi goal we cannot alway choos our friend but we can never fail to recogn our enemi as presid i will call for intern confer focus on thi goal we will work sidebysid with our friend in the middl east includ our greatest alli israel we will partner with king abdullah of jordan and the presid of egypt presid sisi and all mother who recogn thi ideolog of death that must be extinguish we will also work veri close with nato on thi new mission i had previous said that nato wa obsolet becaus it fail to deal adequ with terror sinc my comment they have chang their polici and now have a new divis focus on terror threat veri good veri veri good i also believ that we could find common ground with russia in the fight against isi wouldnt that be a good thing they too have much at stake in the outcom in syria and have had their own battl with islam terror just as bad as our they have a big big problem in russia with isi my administr will aggress pursu joint and coalit militari oper to crush and destroy isi intern cooper to cut off their fund expand intellig share and cyber warfar to distrust and disabl their propaganda and recruit their recruit is take place right now and theyr set record it got to be stop we cannot allow the internet to be use as a recruit tool and for other purpos by our enemi we must shut down there access to thi form of commun and we must do it immedi immedi unlik hillari clinton who is risk so mani live with her careless handl of sensit inform my administr will not telegraph exactli militari plan and what they are and by the way what happen with her 33000 email is an absolut disgrac for the unit state ive often said that the great gener dougla macarthur and a great gener georg patton would be in a state of shock if they were aliv today to see the way presid obama and hillari clinton tri to recklessli announc their everi move befor it happen like they did in iraq so that the enemi can prepar and adapt their enemi si thank you the fight will not be limit to isi we will decim al qaeda and we will seek to starv punter for a ran back to mosqu and hezbollah so import we can use exist un secur council resolut to appli new and even stronger sanction militari cyber and financi warfar will all be necessari to dismantl islam terror but we must use ideolog warfar as well veri import and they use it on us better than we have ever even thought of use it on them but that will chang just as we won thank you just as we won the cold war part by expos the evil of commun and the virtu of free market so too must we take on the ideolog of radic islam while my oppon accept million of dollar in foundat donat from countri where be gay is an offens punish by prison or death my administr will speak out against the oppress of women gay and peopl of differ belief our administr would be a friend to all moder muslim reform in the middl east and will amplifi their voic thi includ speak out against a horribl practic of honor kill where women are murder by their rel for dress marri or act in a way that violat fundamentalist teach over 1000 pakistani girl are estim to be the victim of honor kill by their rel each year recent a promin pakistani social media star wa strangl to death by her brother on the charg of dishonour the famili in hi confess the brother took pride in the murder and said girl are born to stay home and follow tradit shockingli thi is a practic that ha reach our own shore on such case and mani mani case have happen but one involv an iraqi immigr who wa sentenc to 34 year in jail for run over hi own daughter claim she had been too western to defeat islam terror we must also speak out forc against a hate ideolog that provid the breed ground for violenc and terror to grow it a breed ground it a terribl terribl breed ground a new immigr polici is need immedi as well the common thread link the major islam terrorist attack that have recent occur on our soil 911 the fort hood shoot the boston bomb the san bernardino attack the orlando attack is that they have involv immigr or the children of immigr clearli new screen procedur are need a review by the us senat immigr subcommitte ha identifi 380 foreignborn individu charg with terror or terrorismrel offens between 911 and 2014 and mani more sinc then and thi year is a record for identif it gotten wors far wors we also know that isi recruit refuge after their entranc into the countri as we have seen with the somali refuge popul in minnesota beyond terror as we have also seen in franc foreign popul have brought their antisemit attitud with them in cologn germani on new year eve we have seen the report of sexual violenc and assault far greater than anybodi know pew poll show that in mani of the countri from which we draw a larg number of immigr extrem view about religion such as the death penalti and for those who are involv the death penalti is veri veri common if you dont have the faith that they demand you have a trumpet administr will establish a clear principl that will govern all decis pertain to immigr and we will be tough and we will conclud we should onli admit into thi countri those who share our valu and respect our peopl in the cold war we had an ideolog screen test the time is overdu to develop a new screen test for the threat we face today i call it extrem vet i call it extrem extrem vet our countri ha enough problem we dont need more and these are problem like weve never in addit to screen out all member of the sympath of terrorist group we must also screen out ani of hostil attitud toward our countri or it principl or who believ that sharia law should supplant american those who do not believ in our constitut or who support bigotri and hatr will not be admit for immigr into our countri onli those that we expect to flourish in our countri and to embrac a toler american societi should be issu visa to put these new procedur in place we will have to temporarili suspend immigr from some of the most danger and volatil region of the world that have a histori of export terror not for us not for us as soon as i take offic i will ask the state depart and the depart of homeland secur to identifi a list of region where adequ screen cannot take place there are mani such region we will stop process visa from those area until such time as it is deem safe to resum base on new circumst or new procedur the size of current immigr flow are simpli too larg to perform adequ scream we had been about 100000 perman immigr from the middl east everi year beyond that we admit hundr of thousand of temporari worker and visitor from the same region hundr of thousand if we dont control the number we cant perform adequ screen there no way it can take us by contrast my oppon want to increas which is unbeliev no matter who you are no matter where you come from want to increas the flow of syrian refuge by five hundr and fifti percent over what they are now the unit state senat subcommitte on immigr estim that hillari clinton plan would mean roughli six hundr and twenti thousand refuge from all current refuge send nation in her first term assum no cut to other refuge program so it could get wors thi would be addit to all other non refuge immigr unbeliev number unbeliev number the subcommitte estim a plan would impos a lifetim cost of roughli 400 billion dollar when you

      "well thi is a thi is a great turn on when you realiz that there i think is anoth room and i saw peopl outsid as were come in lead me to believ that i have a hunch who go to carri florida now obvious im here to talk with you about donald trump and the presid but i wa talk to our folk in the media back there okay okay okay all right so you dont like them quit as much as you like donald i get it i get that but they ask me a veri veri good seriou question and so i dont know take a minut or two to talk at a veri seriou level as a former speaker of the hous rememb the defens polici board and somebodi who is realli concern about safeti and surviv in america we just saw today secretari clinton okay okay alright alright so im guess base on the nois level that you like her even less than the media but let me tri to go beyond just polit to talk about nation secur and our surviv and secretari clinton comment today now weve had attack in new jersey in new york appar from the same person an attack in minnesota from a differ person and of cours initi we were reassur that we had no proof that new york wa a terrorist and werent quit sure that the incid in minnesota is a terrorist saw those pretti obviou but secretari clinton decid in exactli thi is what make it frankli weird in exactli the same pattern that she use about benghazi she decid the problem wasnt islam supremacist the problem wasnt isi the problem wasnt intern terrorist who want to destroy our civil now chioda press confer today were made a press statement who she doesnt do press confer well up let be fair it is veri difficult to have a press confer if you have as mani differ exampl of dishonesti corrupt and error as hillari clinton so she just doesnt have them in hope that her friend in the media will not quit notic so today she came out and she had a statement she had figur out what wa behind the knife attack in minnesota and what wa behind what we now would we are bomb even though the news media attack trump for say they were bomb becaus after all when a bomb goe off it call a bomb and so if you see a bomb go off your allow to say it a bomb even if cnn edit is so it doesnt say it a bomb is still a bomb so onc again you had donald trump tell the truth and describ a bomb as though it were a bomb which of cours did the elit media wa an enorm shock and let me describ terror as though wa terror at thi point some peopl were contempl heart attack and what about but hillari clinton cut right through she channel the lie she told back in benghazi which rememb she told the mother of a dead soldier wa in fact caus by a film even though she knew that wa a total lie and ask yourself how cold how cold and heartless do you have to be to lie to a mother about the death of her son so secretari clinton came out today and she said the caus is clear it donald from now think about thi we have been a war with radic islamist sinc the ayatollah khomeini took over iran in 1979 seiz the american embassi and held our hostag we had we had bomb in the 1980 we had bomb in 1990 weve been involv in a long war for 15 year but hillari clinton ha figur it out donald trump appar magic in 1979 without realiz it launch the terrorist war i mean actual said that he wasnt even in busi in manhattan yet but he wa so precoci as a young man so fill with talent that appar all of us is due to him now do you know how derang you have to be to say thi with a straight face meanwhil the white hous we assur us that were in a competit between two narr now again you know how out of touch with realiti you have to be to reduc the knife of innoc peopl bomb which wound i think 29 peopl to two narr and the question we have to say to our liber friend is no thi isnt a fight between narr thi is a life and death struggl with extremist who would destroy us and we have to be strong enough to defend america and do what it take to be safe so onc onc again if you did hear that polit incorrect check there are peopl over here appar whose think it still ok to say usa you say that how you know what it from graviti so let be veri clear as you go back home later on you talk to your friend as you get on email or twitter or facebook and you commun with your rel and your friend around the countri we are in a elect struggl between a first ladi us senat secretari of state who is total out of touch with realiti and whose polici put america and risk and a remark entrepreneuri leader who ha come out of nowher in a way which is absolut histor unimagin i mean im a historian i have written book about it i taught it no one in american histori ha organ a popular movement on thi scale ha done so in one year and ha done so without ever run for offic so in a minut your go to hear from someon who i believ can genuin chang histori can liter help creat job onc again can liter help reform washington can break up the rig game which is cheat most of us on behalf of the few can elimin the corrupt which ha come

so long as you know in boston we want it with a highli respect judg and a veri strong opinion but now were in an area that let just say they are interpret thing differ than probabl a hundr percent of the peopl in thi room id like to almost no doe anybodi disagre when i want to read thi but im go to read watch what in disput what in question and youll see thi it i n 8 to 12 f 8 usc 1182 f suspens of entri or imposit of restrict by the presid okay now thi isnt just me thi is for obama for ronald reagan for the presid and thi wa done veri importantli for secur someth you peopl know more about then all of us wa done for the secur of our nation the secur of our citizen so that peopl come in who arent go to do us harm and that whi it wa done and it couldnt have been written ani more precis it not like oh gee we wish it were written better wa written beauti so just listen here what it say thi is what theyr argu whenev the presid find that the entri of ani alien ok the entri the entri of ani alien or of ani class of alien so ani alien ani class of alien into the unit state so the entri of peopl into the unit state let say just to be precis of alien into the unit state so anytim whenev the presid find at the entri of ani alien or ani class of ellen into the unit state would be detriment to the interest of the unit state right so if i find as presid that a person or a group of peopl will be detriment to the interest of the unit state and certainli there lot of exampl that we have but you shouldnt even have them necessarili he may be and he may by proclam and for such period as he shall deem necessari now the onli mistak is they should have said he or she but hope it wont be a sheet for at least anoth seven year after that im oh hey i just notic that actual just notic that im say wow thi is not polit correct it correct but it not polit correct you know becaus the old day he made by proclam and for such period as he shall deem necessari so here it is peopl come in suspend the entri of all alien right it not like again a bad high school student would understand thi anybodi would understand us suspend the entri of all alien or ani class of alien as immigr or nonimmigr or impos or the entri of alien okay so you can suspend the alien right you can suspend the alien from come veri strong or impos on the entri of alien ani restrict he may deem to be appropri okay so you can suspend you can put restrict you can do whatev you want and thi is for the secur of the countri which again your the chief your the sheriff you understand thi and i listen to lawyer on both side last night and they were talk about thing that had just noth to do with it i listen to a panel of judg and ill comment on that i will not comment on the statement made by certainli one judg but i have to be honest that if these judg want to in my opinion help the court in term of respect for the court they do what they should be do i mean it it so sad they should be you know when you read someth so simpl and so beauti written and so perfectli written other than the one statement of cours have to do with he or she but when you read someth so perfectli written and so clear to anybodi and then you have lawyer and you watch i watch last night in amaz and i heard thing that i couldnt believ thing that realli had noth to do with what i just read and i dont ever want to call a court bia so i wont call it bias and we havent had a decis yet but court seem to be so polit and it would be so great for a justic system if they would be abl to read a statement and do what right and that ha to do with the secur of our countri which is so import right now we are at risk becaus of what happen gener kelli is an extrem talent man in a veri good man now secretari kerri homeland secur we are do our job great man were do our job and one of the reason you probabl heard that we did it so quickli i could have in fact i said let give a one month notic and then law enforc and gener kelli wa so great becaus he said we total knew about it if we knew about everyth we do thing well we do thing right but the law enforc peopl said to me oh you cant give a notic becaus if you give a notic that your go to be realli tough in one month from now or in one week from now i suggest a month and i said well what about a week they said no you cant do that becaus then peopl are go to pour in befor the tough goe on do you peopl agre i mean you know more about law than anybodi law enforc so i want to give like a month then i said well what about a week they said well then your gonna have a whole pile of peopl perhap perhap with veri evil intent come in befor the restrict so there it is folk it a plant it as plain as you can have it i didnt and i wa a good student i understand thing i comprehend veri well okay better than i think almost anybodi and i want to tell you i listen to a bunch of stuff last night on televis that wa disgrac it wa disgrac becaus what i just read to you is what we have and it just cant be written ani plainer or better and for us to be go through thi and by the way a highli highli respect judg in boston rule veri strongli in our favor you heard that like i said to my peopl whi dont you use the boston case and there were reason whi they couldnt use the boston case thi when can later variou reason but use the boston case and i wont read that but there were statement made by that judg who again highli respect that were right on they were product they were perfect so i think it sad i think it a sad day i think our secur is at risk today and it will be at risk until such time as we are entitl and get what we are entitl to as citizen of thi countri as chief and sheriff of thi countri we want secur one of the reason i wa elect wa becaus of law and order and secur that one of the reason i wa elect also job and lot of other thing but i think one of the strongest reason is secur and theyr take away our weapon one by one that what theyr do and you know it and i know it and you peopl have been veri unhappi for a long period of time and i can read the poll may be better than anybodi becaus it seem that i understood the poll a lot better than mani of the

they never sat down but i want to thank you all i have great great love for what you do and the way you do it and when im with the polic chief and im with the sheriff of our countri and these are the

so long as you know in boston we want it with a highli respect judg and a veri strong opinion but now were in an area that let just say they are interpret thing differ than probabl a hundr percent of the peopl in thi room id like to almost no doe anybodi disagre when i want to read thi but im go to read watch what in disput what in question and youll see thi it i n 8 to 12 f 8 usc 1182 f suspens of entri or imposit of restrict by the presid okay now thi isnt just me thi is for obama for ronald reagan for the presid and thi wa done veri importantli for secur someth you peopl know more about then all of us wa done for the secur of our nation the secur of our citizen so that peopl come in who arent go to do us harm and that whi it wa done and it couldnt have been written ani more precis it not like oh gee we wish it were written better wa written beauti so just listen here what it say thi is what theyr argu whenev the presid find that the entri of ani alien ok the entri the entri of ani alien or of ani class of alien so ani alien ani class of alien into the unit state so the entri of peopl into the unit state let say just to be precis of alien into the unit state so anytim whenev the presid find at the entri of ani alien or ani class of ellen into the unit state would be detriment to the interest of the unit state right so if i find as presid that a person or a group of peopl will be detriment to the interest of the unit state and certainli there lot of exampl that we have but you shouldnt even have them necessarili he may be and he may by proclam and for such period as he shall deem necessari now the onli mistak is they should have said he or she but hope it wont be a sheet for at least anoth seven year after that im oh hey i just notic that actual just notic that im say wow thi is not polit correct it correct but it not polit correct you know becaus the old day he made by proclam and for such period as he shall deem necessari so here it is peopl come in suspend the entri of all alien right it not like again a bad high school student would understand thi anybodi would understand us suspend the entri of all alien or ani class of alien as immigr or nonimmigr or impos or the entri of alien okay so you can suspend the alien right you can suspend the alien from come veri strong or impos on the entri of alien ani restrict he may deem to be appropri okay so you can suspend you can put restrict you can do whatev you want and thi is for the secur of the countri which again your the chief your the sheriff you understand thi and i listen to lawyer on both side last night and they were talk about thing that had just noth to do with it i listen to a panel of judg and ill comment on that i will not comment on the statement made by certainli one judg but i have to be honest that if these judg want to in my opinion help the court in term of respect for the court they do what they should be do i mean it it so sad they should be you know when you read someth so simpl and so beauti written and so perfectli written other than the one statement of cours have to do with he or she but when you read someth so perfectli written and so clear to anybodi and then you have lawyer and you watch i watch last night in amaz and i heard thing that i couldnt believ thing that realli had noth to do with what i just read and i dont ever want to call a court bia so i wont call it bias and we havent had a decis yet but court seem to be so polit and it would be so great for a justic system if they would be abl to read a statement and do what right and that ha to do with the secur of our countri which is so import right now we are at risk becaus of what happen gener kelli is an extrem talent man in a veri good man now secretari kerri homeland secur we are do our job great man were do our job and one of the reason you probabl heard that we did it so quickli i could have in fact i said let give a one month notic and then law enforc and gener kelli wa so great becaus he said we total knew about it if we knew about everyth we do thing well we do thing right but the law enforc peopl said to me oh you cant give a notic becaus if you give a notic that your go to be realli tough in one month from now or in one week from now i suggest a month and i said well what about a week they said no you cant do that becaus then peopl are go to pour in befor the tough goe on do you peopl agre i mean you know more about law than anybodi law enforc so i want to give like a month then i said well what about a week they said well then your gonna have a whole pile of peopl perhap perhap with veri evil intent come in befor the restrict so there it is folk it a plant it as plain as you can have it i didnt and i wa a good student i understand thing i comprehend veri well okay better than i think almost anybodi and i want to tell you i listen to a bunch of stuff last night on televis that wa disgrac it wa disgrac becaus what i just read to you is what we have and it just cant be written ani plainer or better and for us to be go through thi and by the way a highli highli respect judg in boston rule veri strongli in our favor you heard that like i said to my peopl whi dont you use the boston case and there were reason whi they couldnt use the boston case thi when can later variou reason but use the boston case and i wont read that but there were statement made by that judg who again highli respect that were right on they were product they were perfect so i think it sad i think it a sad day i think our secur is at risk today and it will be at risk until such time as we are entitl and get what we are entitl to as citizen of thi countri as chief and sheriff of thi countri we want secur one of the reason i wa elect wa becaus of law and order and secur that one of the reason i wa elect also job and lot of other thing but i think one of the strongest reason is secur and theyr take away our weapon one by one that what theyr do and you know it and i know it and you peopl have been veri unhappi for a long period of time and i can read the poll may be better than anybodi becaus it seem that i understood the poll a lot better than mani of the
